COMMENT KEY:
-- Rylock
<--- Schwarherz

Things we should probably get rid of (at least for now):
* the contested CB stuff -- why wasn't this just a decision/event that gave someone a claim over lands that rightfully belonged to them?
* the Culturally Different Cities stuff <--- It just takes up a lot of space. We may want to see if it would be easier to just maintain compatibility.
* the melting pot/crusader cultures <--- May be best to either rework these or scrap them completely. They're a mess. For most of the events to create them you don't get a choice, it just happens.

Things I'd like to see us keep:
* the new ambitions -- when I'm playing, I really like that these are different
* tyranny system
* the female ruler/tournament stuff -- since I just re-did them
* the Celtic religion stuff -- there's quite a bit, but it's cool <---I concur. We may want to update it a bit, though. Either through their source (Ancient Religions) or our own tinkering
* the changes to buildings <--- I concur here as well
* HRE specific balances <--- Forces the emperor to be crowned by the pope or deal with extremely limited power.

Stuff for later:
* ambitions:
	get the favored son ambition to actually mean something (and include favored daughter)
	bastards gaining/earning their own legitimacy (instead of just through their mothers)
	an ambition for non-landed courtiers with strong claims to regain their lands
	a "status quo" ambition for the AI, making sure that the various ambitions tie more into what the AI chooses to do
	getting the AI to ambandon ambitions that aren't going anywhere after awhile
	Gain Family Name ambition for lowborn AI and a decision for a lord to grant it to them (not un-important lowborns obviously) <--- Not entirely sure if this is possible, but put it here anyway just in case
* lifestyles:
	make sure the lifestyle globals are added in more places -- they're not, currently, and are really needed for the mod's lifestyle events to work properly
	add some unique events which add those globals independently
* plots:
	plots that target people outside your realm, to do things other than assassinate (so espionage--discrediting a ruler to his own people, getting secrets that give one a tactical edge, sabotaging fortifications, etc.)
	having some events & AI decisions that help them work towards completing plots (other than the ham-handed "make everyone friendlier to the AI" maintenance event)
* succession laws:
	revisit the AI evaluation for feudal elective voters approving/disapproving of law changes
	something to make an heir who becomes neither an heir nor pretender after a law change get REALLY angry
	conversely, something to make someone who BECOMES heir after a law change get REALLY happy (though, possibly murder-ey as well for obvious reasons.)
* Titles:
	give some sort of meaning for the minor titles so they're not entirely pointless for everything but mood (also restrict Court Jester to non-landed courtiers)
	Add a k_franconia and k_swabia to round out the german stem duchies. Possibly make them, along with Bavaria and Saxony landed at some point in history to represent their autonomy.
	Fully incorporate Alternate Titular Titles (Well...most of it. There are some bits I can, and intend to, live without)
* Histories:
	A LOT of cleaning required <--- we probably shouldn't worry too much about the "x is too young for y" problems with it. More focus on the "x is dead when he receives y title" and "x has condition y but not trait z" problems
* Culture/religion spread
	Look at speeding this up a bit <--- It's not uncommon for a player to go a full game with only one or two provinces converting over several hundred years. This doesn't seem realistic to me. From a historical standpoint, England is a good example of how this makes no sense
* Religions: <--- putting this here so I dont forget and/or can get feedback (I only have pagan stuff for now because they're the most lacking in flavor)
	ALL religion heads should be kingdoms (barring the caliphates if they're vassals to kings in the histories) <--- Looking into history I see no basis for the caliphates being vassals to anyone despite them being vassals to three different kingdoms in the game. We may want to remedy this.
	All pagans get 4 seasonal festivals (1 per season) If reformed, this is declared by the Head of Religion and individual rulers of that faith decide how elaborate theirs will be (or if they'll have it at all)
	Restore unreformed pagan's ability to demand conversion so as to coincide with the change in the AI behavior outlined in the religions file. <--- perhaps make it only for the AI or if they have the zealous trait so as to preserve gameplay
	Give religion heads that aren't the pope something to do <--- Right now playing as a religion head basically just means congratulations you have another title. May need some events or be the target of some religious themed decisions
	Reformed Norse: Forn Siðr
	Reformed Finnish: Suomenusko
	Reformed Baltic: Romuva
	Reformed Slavic: Rodnovery
	Reformed Celtic: ????
	Hellenic: Olympianism? <--- can't find a reference to a name for it other than Hellenic, Olympianism, or Dodekatheism
	Egyptian: ????
	Traits representing each of the Hellenic mystery religions (Much like the RoI patron deity system for the Indian religions)
	Finnish pagan: needs Perkele's name changed to Ukko to avoid any...incidents. Perkele is considered an obscenity in modern Finnish and Ukko is another name for the same god.
	Relevant flavor to each religion based on its mythos and traditions (much like paradox has already provided for the Norse)
	Completely re-do egyptian religion <--- at the moment it's a Zoroastrian clone with less flavor
	Give more reformed religions the ability to have a secular(ish) head. Short list: Norse (vanilla), Slavic, Baltic (Slavic, Baltic, and Norse religion apparently share common elements. Left out Celts and Egyptians because their religions have too much of a priestly tradition)
	If possible, a decision for secular religious heads to make the title landless (that is, existing forever) and give it away to an actual priest for the good of the faith
	Mesoamerican heresies for the Aztecs to deal with
