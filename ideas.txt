Things we should probably get rid of (at least for now):
* the new plots/factions -- these are currently a giant, uncommented mess... if we add them back in, it'll require some serious re-evaluation
* the contested CB stuff -- why wasn't this just a decision/event that gave someone a claim over lands that rightfully belonged to them?

Things I'd like to see us keep:
* the new ambitions -- when I'm playing, I really like that these are different
* tyranny system
* the female ruler/tournament stuff -- since I just re-did them
* the Celtic religion stuff -- there's quite a bit, but it's cool
* the changes to buildings
