Things we should probably get rid of (at least for now):
* the new factions -- these are currently a giant, uncommented mess... if we add them back in, it'll require some serious re-evaluation
* the contested CB stuff -- why wasn't this just a decision/event that gave someone a claim over lands that rightfully belonged to them?

Things I'd like to see us keep:
* the new ambitions -- when I'm playing, I really like that these are different
* tyranny system
* the female ruler/tournament stuff -- since I just re-did them
* the Celtic religion stuff -- there's quite a bit, but it's cool
* the changes to buildings

Stuff for later:
* ambitions:
	get the favored son ambition to actually mean something (and include favored daughter)
	bastards gaining/earning their own legitimacy (instead of just through their mothers)
	an ambition for non-landed courtiers with strong claims to regain their lands
	a "status quo" ambition for the AI, making sure that the various ambitions tie more into what the AI chooses to do
	getting the AI to ambandon ambitions that aren't going anywhere after awhile
* plots:
	plots that target people outside your realm, to do things other than assassinate (so espionage--discrediting a ruler to his own people, getting secrets that give one a tactical edge, sabotaging fortifications, etc.)
	having some events & AI decisions that help them work towards completing plots (other than the ham-handed "make everyone friendlier to the AI" maintenance event)
* succession laws:
	revisit the AI qualifications for changing the laws -- they're very basic right now, and often don't make much sense (and don't take into account current gender laws)
	revisit the AI evaluation for feudal elective voters approving/disapproving of law changes
	something to make an heir who becomes neither an heir nor pretender after a law change get REALLY angry
