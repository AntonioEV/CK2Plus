Things we should probably get rid of (at least for now):
* the new factions -- these are currently a giant, uncommented mess... if we add them back in, it'll require some serious re-evaluation
* the contested CB stuff -- why wasn't this just a decision/event that gave someone a claim over lands that rightfully belonged to them?

Things I'd like to see us keep:
* the new ambitions -- when I'm playing, I really like that these are different
* tyranny system
* the female ruler/tournament stuff -- since I just re-did them
* the Celtic religion stuff -- there's quite a bit, but it's cool
* the changes to buildings

Stuff for later:
* ambitions:
	get the favored son ambition to actually mean something (and include favored daughter)
	bastards gaining/earning their own legitimacy (instead of just through their mothers)
	an ambition for non-landed courtiers with strong claims to regain their lands
	a "status quo" ambition for the AI, making sure that the various ambitions tie more into what the AI chooses to do
	getting the AI to ambandon ambitions that aren't going anywhere after awhile
* plots:
	plots that target people outside your realm, to do things other than assassinate (so espionage--discrediting a ruler to his own people, getting secrets that give one a tactical edge, sabotaging fortifications, etc.)
	having some events & AI decisions that help them work towards completing plots (other than the ham-handed "make everyone friendlier to the AI" maintenance event)
* succession laws:
	revisit the AI qualifications for changing the laws -- they're very basic right now, and often don't make much sense (and don't take into account current gender laws)
	revisit the AI evaluation for feudal elective voters approving/disapproving of law changes
	something to make an heir who becomes neither an heir nor pretender after a law change get REALLY angry
	conversely, something to make someone who BECOMES heir after a law change get REALLY happy (though, possibly murder-ey as well for obvious reasons.)
* Titles:
	give some sort of meaning for the minor titles so they're not entirely pointless for everything but mood (also restrict Court Jester to non-landed courtiers)
	Add a k_franconia and k_swabia to round out the german stem duchies. Possibly make them, along with Bavaria and Saxony landed at some point in history to represent their autonomy.
* Religions: *putting this here so I dont forget and/or can get feedback (I only have pagan stuff for now because they're the most lacking in flavor)
	All pagans get 4 seasonal festivals (1 per season) If reformed, this is declared by the Head of Religion and individual rulers of that faith decide how elaborate theirs will be (or if they'll have it at all)
	Reformed Norse: Forn Siðr
	Reformed Finnish: Suomenusko
	Reformed Baltic: Romuva
	Reformed Slavic: Rodnovery
	Hellenic: Olympianism? (can't find a reference to a name for it other than Hellenic, Olympianism, or Dodekatheism)
	Traits representing each of the Hellenic mystery religions (Much like the RoI patron deity system for the Indian religions)
	Finnish pagan: needs Perkele's name changed to Ukko to avoid any...incidents. Perkele is considered an obscenity in modern Finnish and Ukko is another name for the same god.
	Relevant flavor to each religion based on its mythos and traditions (much like paradox has already provided for the Norse)
