Things we should probably get rid of (at least for now):
* the new plots/factions -- these are currently a giant, uncommented mess... if we add them back in, it'll require some serious re-evaluation
* the contested CB stuff -- why wasn't this just a decision/event that gave someone a claim over lands that rightfully belonged to them?

Things I'd like to see us keep:
* the new ambitions -- when I'm playing, I really like that these are different
* tyranny system
* the female ruler/tournament stuff -- since I just re-did them
* the Celtic religion stuff -- there's quite a bit, but it's cool
* the changes to buildings

Stuff for later:
* ambitions: bastards gaining/earning their own legitimacy (instead of just through their mothers), an ambition for non-landed courtiers with strong claims to regain their lands, a "status quo" ambition for the AI, making sure that the various ambitions tie more into what the AI chooses to do, getting the AI to ambandon ambitions that aren't going anywhere after awhile
