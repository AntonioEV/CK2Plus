changelog 4.01.1

* MAJOR: A system for martyrs and saints added. A non-heretic Christian character may be declared a martyr if they die facing infidels in battle during a holy war or a crusade, or if they are executed by an infidel. Upon death, a character may also be considered for sainthood provided they have very high Piety or some other qualifications (such as a Paragon of Virtue, a martyr, a religion head, or the Voice of Jesus modifier) and no other traits that would disqualify them -- if they are declared a saint, their portrait changes and their heirs receive Piety.
* Supply limits upped slightly, and maximum attrition levels applied for the winter effects.
* Fixed being unable to build some trade post buildings.
* Fixed income gain from Toll Booths and Customs Houses.
* Re-localized Zikri back to its original name.
* Added spouse/consort conversion decision for Chalcedonian.
* The Paulician Patriarch no longer inherits the Antioch Patriarchate if they are not a theocracy.
* Religion head titles which are inherited/usurped, but belong to a different religion, are now either reverted back to their previous owner (if they're alive) or destroyed.
* Ineligible courtiers of the player will no longer get married.
* Added age customization traits for the Ruler Designer -- select them to reduce your starting age by a set amount, and they disappear once the game begins.
* If using the Ruler Designer, you can now select a "Customize Ruler Dynasty" trait, which will allow you to assign an existing character as a relative and assume their dynasty (only if you don't select the Bastard trait, however, in which case you keep your Ruler Designer dynasty but still get the relatives). This is only useable in the first 15 days of the game.
* The events which destroy Byzantium/HRE/Latin Empire due to having the wrong religion now create a custom empire title to replace it if you aren't eligible for the normal one, if no empire has been based on the kingdom of your capital already, and so long as you have a proper realm size to support it. The vassals which could possibly go independent as a result will only be those who are also de jure vassals of the destroyed title.
* Lombardy now has the vanilla flag rather than Italy's flag.
* Italy now has the proper title history for Lombardy in the Old Gods start and later.
* Made the AI slightly more aggressive.
* The Chalcedonian Pope is now more likely to pick cardinals closer to home.
* Duchy adventurers given a set of logical preferences regarding what their target realms will be, and seafaring adventurers are restricted to targets within their logical "sea range".
* Raiding adventurers will now properly recruit more soldiers with any money they've gained (vanilla bug fixed).
* Raiding adventurers will not raid their former liege or any of his vassals for at least five years, if he liked the liege at all.
* Fixed pillage settlement decision to properly apply the effects (vanilla bug fixed).
* Nomads may now only abandon provinces which have no settlements (vanilla bug fixed).
* The Byzantine Empire may now be formed by Chalcedonians.
* The Paulician Patriarch no longer grants divorces.
* Fixed the "Rule For 20 Years" ambition so it won't cancel if you're not independent.
* Religion heads will excommunicate anyone of the same religion, if attacked (provided they can).
* Attacking a religion head will also prompt rulers to offer support -- sometimes joining their war, sometimes offering coin and volunteers.
* Catholic/Orthodox holy orders will resume their normal religions after the schism, if they've been formed.
* Waldensian sacking events now won't single out Koln, Canterbury, and Santiago as holy sites prior to the schism.
* Added a CB which may be used by non-nomads to take any bordering county held by a nomad.
* Religious and Heretic rebels will now always usurp all provinces of their religion from the top liege, in addition to any occupied provinces.
* Decadence rebels will now always usurp the province they revolted in, in addition to any occupied provinces. They will also take the top liege prisoner.
* Tribals may use an Establish Tribe decision in a province with no settlements, costing 100 Prestige and immediately building a tribe settlement in the capital slot.
* Rulers who are neither tribal nor nomadic may use an Establish Castle decision in a province with no settlements, costing 100 Wealth and immediately building a castle settlement in the capital slot.
* Hungary's establishment by the magyars now allows the k_hungary title to be subsequently usurpred and/or re-created.
* Reduced the amount of taxes nomads get from Population.
* Reduced the amount of max Population increased for nomads for each empty province.
* Nomads no longer get to call the full levy of their non-nomadic vassals without regard for their opinion.
* Fixed Anglo-Norse not receiving a cultural building.
* Tribal invasions can only be performed against a target kingdom when they own at least one county in the kingdom or a neighbouring province.
* Empty nomad provinces which are conquered but which don't have the same culture as the attacker will automatically build a tribal holding (and thus retain their previous culture).
* Nomads can now only destroy the last holding in a province when the province is of their own culture.
* Nomad stewards may now use the Settle Province job action to more quickly change a province's culture.
* Both tribal invasions and nomad invasions (the ones which target Kingdom titles) now require 500 Prestige to use.
* Paulician and Kharijite crusades against same-religion group targets will no longer invalidate.
* Duel Engine changes:
	-Instead of automatically being maimed, characters who take wounds while already wounded will lose some health. Any health lost this way will be regained over time after the battle (assuming the character lives long enough to recover). There remains a small chance of being maimed or made incapable by taking hits in duels.
	-Characters made incapable during a duel will automatically yield. Opponents may then choose what to do with them (kill them, take them captive, or, for battlefield duels, just leave them there.
	-AI characters that lose a round are inceasingly likely to yield as the fight goes on and/or as they lose more and more health.	
	-Martial score no longer directly affects the outcome of duels, it is now primarily driven by personal combat skill, personal combat traits, and other relevant traits. Martial education traits still have a small effect.
	-The events concluding holmgangs should no longer fire twice.
