changelog 3.07.6

* Bavaria/Saxony kings (and ducal vassals) no longer become independent when the Carolingian Empire is formed by a Frankish emperor.
* Patrician mansion holdings are no longer given out with the automated "give out holdings" decision.
* The "Found Merchant Republic" and "Adopt Feudalism" decisions are both now visible to players from the outset.
* The automated decisions to ransom prisoners are now only visible if you actually have prisoners (they previously appeared if some of your courtiers were held prisoner by others).
* Decadence may now occasionally increase if a muslim emperor has a very large realm, regardless of their other traits.
* Added a new type of revolter: decadence uprising, which can occur under a muslim ruler with 50+ decadence and in provinces with the "decadence unrest" province modifier (which can occasionally appear in provinces under a top liege with high decadence). This works the same as other revolters, with victory establishing a new realm under the revolter's rule.
