changelog 3.06.6

* Fixed Hamburg to properly be a republic in 1066.
* Pechenegs no longer show as vassals of Khazaria in 867.
* Mongols will no longer default to Open Elective succession.
* AI discouraged from using holy war CB on titles that are not neighbors to continguous land.
* Slighty decreased supply limit for provinces infected with small pox and the bubonic plague. Also added a small revolt risk to provinces having a disease outbreak.
* The Theodosian Walls will no longer disappear under an AI Byzantine emperor.
* Cadet system revamped. Now a cadet is flagged as such if he has an older legitimate brother, is in a dynasty with 40+ living members, and the dynasty head is not a close relative to him or his wife or parents. He also cannot be married matrilineally or be heir to any titles. Provided none of that changes, should he eventually get a title (that does not have tanistry, seniority, or elective gavelkind succession) he may establish a cadet branch dynasty of his own (though the AI will only do this if they are ambitious, proud, or a legitimatised bastard). The player can only establish a cadet branch if they take over play of a character who has previously been flagged as a possible cadet but are otherwise eligible.
* AI made slightly less likely to marry below their rank or accept a marriage offer below their rank.
* Asking for claims from your religion head now requires 250 Piety, not 100, and also requires 100 coin. They are also a bit less likely to agree.
* Converted some Central Asian and Russia provinces to tribal in CM and TOG start dates.
* Courtiers of holy orders are no longer eligible to become adventurers.
* Removed the de jure kingdom of Alania, folded it and part of the western arm of Cumania into a de jure kingdom of Khazaria.
* Revamped how the Mongol Empire works in CK2: now, if one starts prior to the Mongol bookmark, when they appear it will be with Genghis Khan as the ruler of the Mongol Empire (as opposed to the Il-Khanate and the Golden Horde separately). Genghis is the proper age and will have all the family who were with him at the time. When and if the ruler of the Mongol Empire dies with at least two chidren and enough territory, the Mongol Empire ceases to be and the territory is split amongst the new hordes: the Golden Horde, the Il-Khanate and, if there's a third son, the Chagatai Khanate (renamed to the Moghul Khanate if not ruled by Chagatai).
* Fixed the instance where an out-of-realm claimant could end up from the wrong liege after a victorious pretender faction installs them to the title.
