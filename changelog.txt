changelog 3.06.5

* Factions are no longer displeased when you grant a landed title -- they are only pleased when you grant a landed title to a member of their faction.
* Claimants to a title you grant, if they are in your realm, will be displeased if you don't grant it to them or a close relative of theirs (-20 if they have a strong claim, -10 if they have a weak claim).
* For the EU4 converter, religion icon strips updated for "El Dorado"
* Fixed de jure claims for vassals to work properly -- de jure claims may now be enforced on behalf of vassals so long as they hold a de jure title (although a kingdom or empire de jure title must still be medium CA or greater)
* Elective Gavelkind now requires a vote from your vassals in order to change the succession law, the same as Tanistry or Feudal Elective.
* Both Tanistry and Feudal Elective are now options for a ruler moving from Elective Gavelkind. Tanistry is available to tribals, as Gavelkind is.
* The cooldown for holy wars is now not added until after the war is resolved (in case it becomes invalid).
* The Carolingian Empire now begins as an Elective Gavelkind rather than a Feudal Elective title.
* Independence events for heirs (under elective gavelkind) or for vassals when the liege is over the vassal limit have been tweaked to make more sense. Independence cannot be declared if the ruler is a child, is imprisoned, or is incapable. The declaration also looks at whether independence will put them next to a larger neighbour who can declare holy war on them.
* Automated stat changes based on age groups have been tweaked, as per LordPeter's suggestion.
* Corrected a few Bulgarian provinces to tribal in CM start
* Brought the cost of creating custom kingdom/empire titles in line with creating standard titles.
* Fixed varangian events so the son can actually return home.
* Unreformed tribals with Tanistry will no longer automatically revert to Gavelkind.
* Tribal vassals now will occasionally convert their holdings to cities or temples, even under feudal lieges.
* Abdication no longer banishes the former ruler to a foreign court.
* Spread out annual maintenance events over a month rather than having them all occur simultaneously (should hopefully help with processor overload-related crashes).
