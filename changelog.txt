changelog 4.01.3

* Forts are now free, but take 60 days to build (instead of 20) and have a much smaller garrison.
* Empty provinces now require 50 soldiers to occupy (instead of 100).
* If a new nomadic khagan is of a different dynasty than the last one, there is a chance that their clans will decide to split off on their own (the chance is based on their clan opinion of you, as well as your relative power to each other, in addition to their personal traits). If they split off, you will get a strong but not inheritable claim on all their counties.
* Tributaries are automatically inherited if a ruler abdicates or his title is passed off to another after a succession crisis.
* Extra daughters for early bookmarks now appear at the start again (instead of after one day) and still have randomized traits.
