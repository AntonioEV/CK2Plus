changelog 3.07.4

* The regular 'Demand Religious Conversion' diplo action has been removed. It has been replaced with 'Attempt Religious Conversion' -- usable under in the same circumstances (though it costs 50 Piety to attempt to convert a vassal, instead of simply 10 for a courtier), you will need to decide your approach (diplomacy, religious debate, or threat of imprisonment if you have at least Medium CA/Tribal Organization) and then the target will respond either with refusal, conversion, or sympathy (though sympathy cannot be gained with threats). Each approach has a different chance of working, depending on the target and circumstances, though only diplomacy/debate can get a target to honestly convert (otherwise they will likely remain sympathetic to their old religion, and/or become Cynical). Be careful debating someone with higher Learning than you, or you may end up becoming sympathetic to THEIR religion, instead!
* Religion heads now always pay 100 Piety for holy wars (never 250), and can go into Piety "debt" if they so desire.
* Fixed stem duchy creation when HRE is created without East Francia having existed first.
* Fixed some duplicate retinues
* Fixed Mongol Empire split event
* "Protected Inheritance" (titles cannot succeed to outside the realm) moved from High to Medium Crown Authority.
* "King's Peace" moved from Medium to High Crown Authority.
* "Title Revocation" moved from Autonomous Vassals to Limited Crown Authority.
* Finally fixed the issue where Liberation Revolt leaders would sometimes end up with a city or temple capital.
* Provinces that are isolated from the top liege's capital now get +2% revolt risk.
* The game's consideration of what's considered a province contiguous to the capital now crosses a single sea zone.
* The Kidnap plot has been re-enabled for the AI to use. The AI will now use it if they are at war with the target, the target has a plot against them (and they can't arrest him), they have a reason to execute the target (and can't arrest him) or the target is a fellow vassal in the same realm with either a vassal or a county that they claim or which is de jure theirs. The player can use the Kidnap plot on anyone, but demanding a county or vassal follows the same restrictions (only against a fellow vassal, and only if the target is yours by claim or by de jure right). You have the option of quietly killing the target if they refuse your demand, but their spymaster may discover the truth. There is another version of the Kidnap plot which is only available for non-rulers, originally used if they were refused a title after a demand (or you broke a promise to give them one). It may now also be used by courtiers with a claim on a county, though the chance is far less if their claim is weak.
