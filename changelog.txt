changelog 4.01.8

* Implemented a 'Taifa Vassals' demesne laws for muslim kings and emperors in Iberia, which will make their vassals more prone to want independence until the laws are changed.
* All Chalcedonian priests may now not marry. The system whereby priests with Greek Rites could retain their spouse was simply too buggy.
* English CoA's will now be set to their proper version upon loading a save (it may be wrong in the title screen, but will set properly upon entering the game). This will not retroactively fix old saves with this issue.
