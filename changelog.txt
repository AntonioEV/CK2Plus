changelog 4.04.1
* Fixed the 'Create Provincia' decisions to account for the map changes.
* Fixed the faction demand for a liege's title so that it works again.
* Removed starting alliance between Khazars/Cumans in the OG bookmark, as it would occasionally make everyone allied with everyone.
* The Byzantine minor title Despot has been made a councillor.
* Added a historical war between the Almoravids and Ghana in 1066
* Made formation of regular titular kingdoms by the AI less common.
* Increased population-per-empty province limit for nomads.
* Added event to have provinces along the trade routes in West Africa possibly convert to Cairo's religion between 900 and 1050 if they are unreformed Pagan.
* Added event to have provinces along the Amber Road in Eastern Europe possibly convert to Byzantium's or Poland's religion between 1000 and 1150 if they are unreformed Pagan.
* Changed the localisation for nomadic Magyars.
* AI Altaic tribal rulers who have a few provinces and high Martial and enough prestige may now switch to Nomadic government.
* Courtiers in the capital of an empire now have a chance of gaining one of three traits over time: Imperial Bureaucrat, Imperial Courtier, or Imperial Guard. These will give them a bonus to their traits, and also prompt them to seek employment as councillors elsewhere in the empire should the Imperial court begin to get full.
* Adjusted the flow of the West African trade network
* Fixed the 'Sidhe Offerings' event so it only has one possible outcome that fires.
* Fixed (hopefully) the occasional liberation revolt result where province capital holdings are changed.
* A liege with Imperial Government revoking a feudal title now properly reverts that title to remain Imperial even when granted to a new vassal.
* Tribal AI will now sometimes use tributary CB against targets which they cannot subjugate.
* Rollo will no longer use tribal/norse CB's.
