changelog 3.07.2

* Holy Wars no longer have a 5-year cooldown before you can use the CB again. Instead, the CB costs 100 Piety to use, and 250 Piety if you've used it within the last five years. This cost is exempt if the duchy you target contains a holy site of your religion OR if you receive sanction from your religion head (if you have one). Sanction requires positive Piety and is acquired through the diplo menu on the target ruler, and your religion head may accept, refuse, or ask for an incentive (in the form of coin, prestige, or a promised temple in the target duchy).
* Ambitious city mayors now have access to a "Usurp County" decision, if they rule either one of the historical merchant republic cities or are in a port city with a highly developed port (though not one in a county that is the capital of a duchy or kingdom). It's only useable on AI targets, but if successful the city will switch to become the capital of the province (if not already) and the mayor will usurp the county (leaving their former liege as the ruler of a barony instead).
* Added separate character modifier icons for each of the main factions, so you can tell which faction a vassal is in by looking at their character info.
* Fixed a result where the faction demands that one of the liege's counties be turned over to the liege -- resulting in the liege going independent -- if the liege was part of the same faction they are, but for his own liege.
* Factions now get a +50 opinion bonus when their demands are agreed to, not +25.
* The faction leader now properly gains prestige when his demand is agreed to, instead of losing it.
* Kings and emperors with low crown authority (Low or Autonomous Vassals CA) and either Primogeniture, Seniority, or Ultimogeniture succession may now undergo a succession crisis if their heir is either considered too young (under 13), is unsuitable (incapable, inbred, lunatic or imbecile), or is female and there are other, possible better options. The vassals will vote to see who gains the throne, provided there is no revolt underway or war for the primary title. Note that the other candidates will be either pretenders (next in line for the throne), children (it may opt for an older daughter even in Agnatic), or dynasty members (the "Seniority" option, for one).
* Feudal kings or emperors with High or Absolute CA may now ask vassals who support them (opinion of 50+) to also support their heir once he comes to power, adding a +50 opinion bonus towards the heir for twenty years. They may refuse, but are less likely to under Absolute CA. It costs prestige to use the decision (100 for a Count, 250 for a Duke, 500 for a King).
* Shattered Realm has been slightly revamped:
	- Depending on which tier of the ruling tiers you select, ie Count, Duke or King, each playable ruler will get a starting fund of around 500, 750 and 1500 respectively
	- A new CB has been added only for Shattered Realm that allows no timer county conquest on any ruler up until realm size 60. It also can't be used after 60 years of the shattered realm start.
	- The way ancient religions picks areas for said religions has been improved. This should cause a slight speed gain on first map generation of any Ancient Religions starts
* Fixed a bug where the Rise of the Hansa event would fire in a province without a city and create a feudal titular king.
* Landless titles (like the mongols) are no longer automatically destroyed when they drop below 100 holdings.
* After a revolt (either to overthrow the ruler or an independence revolt), a king- or emperor-tier primary title with 0 Crown Authority may be destroyed. This requires that the CA was raised to 1 at some point in the game (so they don't collapse after their first rebellion, especially in early timelines), and the ruler will have a chance to salvage their title if they pay half the cost it would to make a custom title of the same tier (they may go into debt, provided they don't already have a loan and have a current positive wealth total). Landless titles are exempt.
* Province-spawned revolts disabled from occurring during the first two years of the game.
* Levies should now properly refill after converting from tribal holdings, so you're not left weak as a kitten until they refill.
* Corrected an issue where vassals with multiple de jure titles would get to vote more than once on succession law changes.
* Title allows re-written to be more uniform and comprehensible
* The Byzantine, Roman, and Holy Roman empires can no longer create kingdom level vassals (with a few exceptions) unless the player changes their laws.
* Lifestyle traits can now again be gained even without the Focus events.
* Fixed Jewish holy site in Negev.
* Cultural buildings are now based on the culture of the province rather than the culture of the ruler.
