changelog 4.01.8

* Implemented a 'Taifa Vassals' demesne laws for muslim kings and emperors in Iberia, which will make their vassals more prone to want independence until the laws are changed.
* All Chalcedonian priests may now not marry. The system whereby priests with Greek Rites could retain their spouse was simply too buggy.
* English CoA's will now be set to their proper version upon loading a save (it may be wrong in the title screen, but will set properly upon entering the game). This will not retroactively fix old saves with this issue.
* Updated Roman/Byzantine province-creation events to be decisions instead, so you can see the requirements before the province is created. You will see decisions for each province once your realm has any counties in or neighboring the province's region.
* Added maintenance event to ensure some religion head titles with papal-type succession don't change their succession type.
* Non-Christian fathers who denounce their illegitimate children will now be properly removed as the child's father.
* Assyrian culture and history added
* Added a "Become a Saint" ambition for Christians -- this will kick off a series of events which can take many years to appear/complete, requiring you to overcome your sins in order to build up a reputation as a Paragon of virtue. It gives you the Paragon trait upon completion (if you manage to complete it), which gives you a *chance* at true sainthood (aside from the benefits of the trait itself) upon your death. Those who have already acquired the Paragon trait through the "Become a Paragon of Virtue" ambition cannot then take this (or vice-versa). Really this is a means to achieve Paragon status without requiring large amounts of Piety alone, and is available to non-rulers. The ambition is visible when you have 100 Piety or more.
* Fixed nomad event where a clan decides to join a departing brother but sometimes will not actually switch liege.
* The event granting the crusade kingdom to a relative now gives preference to closer kin, and will only have an option for more distant kin if nobody closer is appropriate.
