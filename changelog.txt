changelog 3.07.7

* Added a warning event that fires at the beginning of the game if you are using Ironman -- some mod features (such as the Imperial Decadence system) have been disabled in Ironman due to save corruption issues that result with the mode, and there are enough issues that we don't recommend using it. If you wish to do so anyhow, go ahead, but please refrain from reporting issues encountered while using Ironman on the CK2+ forums.
* The Lord Spiritual can now be female for ALL religions that allow female temple holders, instead of just some.
* All non-Muslim Lord Spirituals save for Lollards must now be either temple holders or have an ecclesiastical education.
* Waldensian bishops may not be Chancellors or Lord Treasurers.
* Cleaned up some of the cultural retinues
* Altered much of the de jure layout in Germany and Lotharingia. Of major note: Both the Duchy of Oldenberg and the Duchy of Brunswick are no longer de jure titles, replaced respectively by the Duchy of Westphalia and the Duchy of Eastphalia. Those both comprise the territory of the historical Duchy of Saxony, which is now eliminated as a de jure ducal title (but still exists as a kingdom-tier title). The Margraviate of Brandenburg added as a kingdom-tier de jure title, active in the 1066 start but previous to that formable if the HRE or one of its duchies gains complete control over Brandenburg and Meissen.
* Reformed Celtic pagans should no longer switch back to Tanistry after they change from it.
* Celtic children should no longer die in druidic training after training has completed.
* Celtic rulers using Offerings to the Sidhe can now have a (smaller) effect on whether provinces owned by direct vassals (or all vassals if top liege is using the decision) gain/lose the Restless Sidhe modifier.
* Using de jure CB's on behalf of your vassals when targeting a valid Holy War target now works once again.
* De jure CB's which cannot be used due to insufficient Crown Authority now display on your list of CB's, but are greyed-out with the reason given.
* Fixed viking invasion CB so it properly grants all occupied counties to the attacker again.
* Rebel reinforcement events should no longer fire on the same day as the original uprising.
* Fixed the "quietly kill him" option for the Kidnap plot to not kill the plotter.
* Updated Iconoclast heresy as per the Heretic Pride mod. Iconoclasts now have extra events, may destroy icons upon besieging a christian temple (and receive the Icon-Breaker trait), and receive a morale bonus for their armies. It is now also possible for an emperor besides the ruler of Byzantium to create an Iconoclast Patriarch.
* Restored the missing d_paulician title, and added its historical holders from founding through to 872 AD. In the 867 start, the Paulicians hold the county of Coloneia and have an army of zealots.
* Updated Paulician heresy as per the Heretic Pride mod. Paulicians now:
	- May raid, as pagans do
	- May declare Holy War on anyone not of the same religion
	- The Paulician Patriarch may declare Crusade against anyone not of the same religion
	- Receive a morale bonus and an offensive bonus for light infantry
	- May expend Piety to raise units of zealots
	- Can receive the Icon-Breaker trait after besieging a Christian temple
* Norse culture provinces should no longer randomly change culture when part of a norse empire.
* Players are no longer restricted from converting to pagan religions if Moral Authority is greater than 50% (the the AI will never do so). They do, however, first need to have received instruction from a mystic on the ancient religion (the event that pops up several years after they've accepted a mystic into their court) and must have the correct traits (pagan sympathy and either cynical or mystic).
* Added note on losing access to raiding and county conquest/subjugation CB's in the reform religion tooltip.
* Fixed the lollard revocation decision.
* Duel Engine changes:
	- Reduced health bonuses from high level warrior traits
	- Added option to run away from some ongoing duels. High intrigue and certain traits 
	will increase the odds of successful escape. Failing to escape will give the winner
	the choice to capture or execute, as if you yielded.
	- Duel Engine is now used to resolve holmgangs, duels at coronation and regular feasts, 
	duels with rivals (both from the Way of Life Combat focus action and from the random 
	challenge event), and duels with your spouse's lover.
* Disabled Legitimise Bastard decision for mothers, as intended. 
Mothers still automatically legitimise any bastards born while they are married matrilineally.
* Fixed duplicate options in "seduce guest at your feast" event
* Germanic Pagans made more distinct from Nordic Pagans (holy sites moved and religion head given distinct title)
* Fixed issue where some elective-style succession laws were still allowed to change to some types of successions without a vote.
* The "Request Religious Conversion" decision now also converts all same-dynasty, non-ruler courtiers of vassals who agree to the conversion.
* The Pope no longer causes provinces under his rule to convert to his culture.
