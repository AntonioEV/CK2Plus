changelog 4.01.7

* Fixed claimant adventurers being able to send the target of their adventure a letter asking for support. Very cheeky of them, no?
* Fixed succession law factions so that, if the liege agrees to the ultimatum, the law on the title is actually changed.
* Fixed some localisation errors in events related to the succession law factions.
* Fixed immediately invalidating Carolingian Imperial Reconquest wars.
* Added a Norman event chain for Rollo to invade or seize control of the Neustrian coast, and perhaps convert or eventually be subjugated.
* Added a Norman melting pot event chain (for Norse rulers with French provinces and vice versa).
* Seduction is now always limited by distance to the target, whether they're both in the same realm or not.
* Fixed liberation revolts from sometimes ending in revolting rulers going independent from their former liege.
* Upped lower-end prerequisites for sainthood, to make them less commonplace.
* New saints only add to a religion's MA if it's below 75%.
* Faction system revolts of rulers who are themselves vassals will no longer be invalidated.
* Merchant Republics overthrown by a regular faction will now always abdicate -- their title is never usurped.
* Religion heads who are theocracies and for whom the religion head title is their primary now lose all claims upon inheriting the title.
* Nationalist revolts now do not apply if the de jure kingdom title of the province where the revolt occurs has a holder in the same realm who is of the province's culture (regardless of whether the top liege does not).
* Claim All CB can now also include weak claims if they are usable when the CB is used.
* Extended the "6 German Duchies" requirement for HRE formation to include de jure Bavaria and Saxony, in case those were not included in the Carolingian Empire.
* If the claimant of a claimant faction is a player, and the title is in their realm, the faction leader will support the player and ask permission. If the player agrees, the faction continues to exist -- but they will not be able to declare support for their liege should the faction rebel, even though they also do not have to support the revolt. If the player refuses, the faction dissolves, and a claimant faction will never form around them again.
* The regular factions will now be more difficult to keep happy.
* Added a "Reconquista" CB for independent Christian rulers in Iberia targeting Muslim titles in Iberia -- it works like the Holy War CB, but with no Piety cost and no cooldown.
* Rulers who should no longer have the Uncrowned/Crowned/Crowned by Pope trait upon a title being usurped should now lose it immediately.
* Nationalist revolts no longer rise up against a top liege who is the religion head of the province's religion, regardless of culture.
* Ruler claimants can no longer join a claimant faction revolting on his/her behalf if he/she is currently fighting in a war alongside their liege.
* Christian & Jewish AI rulers will no longer declare war on their rightful religious head unless they are cynical, excommunicated, or crazy.
