changelog 3.01

* expanded Carolingian Empire in 867 to its actual borders
* whenever the Carolingian title changes hands, provided it's at low or no CA, there's a chance that disaffected vassals will declare independence. They are less likely to do so if closely related to the new emperor or of the same dynasty. If the resulting empire becomes too small, then the Carolingian Empire disbands and the title becomes inactive -- opening up creation of the HRE.
* restored the king titles of Lotharingia, Italy, and Burgundy for the 867 start, which weren't being used
* added setup event for Carolingian Empire in 867 to simulate the rivalries between the kings in the empire
* made Sardinia its own de jure kingdom separate from Italy
* added an austerity system for the AI, so under certain conditions (has a loan, at war with a stronger enemy, has a king or duchy title they are eligible to form) they will be restricted from spending money on lesser expenses like buildings or events; when the AI is saving up, they will hit up vassals for money in the same manner as if they were bankrupt; the AI will now only take loans if they are at war with someone who has a higher title, any of their realm provinces are occupied, they are at negative wealth, or they are saving up for an important expense
* updated pardon decision so it properly removes all execute/imprison opinion modifiers
* added proto-Russian cultures into 867 bookmark provinces
* hopefully found instances where a character could become their own lover and removed them
* added chances for children to be born barren or with lower fertility, and to possibly gain that after illness or childbirth -- this is hidden from view. Women who are married and barren may have an event appear where they suspect they are barren, and can attempt to do something about it (with some degree of risk)
* hid the removal of the "currently busy" modifier when events end
* fixed the AI ambition timer so the player doesn't see it displayed
* only adults will approach you to train your daughtnow now, and preference is given to relatives and allies
* when k_france and k_aquitaine are held by the same person, and event can now fire that unites both kingdoms under de jure k_france
* fixed the voting on succession law changes so it now actually complies with tanistry law
* made it easier for the AI to form Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Ireland, and England
* fixed the bugged application of opinion modifiers to one's liege
* succession laws should no longer sometimes revert after the ruler's death
* fixed the event which called on Catholics to defend the Pope -- so they only receive the event when the Pope is at war with a Catholic ruler
