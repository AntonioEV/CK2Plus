changelog 4.03.0

* MAJOR: coalition/infamy mechanics are now used -- we are currently employing vanilla settings for this, and would appreciate feedback on how it works.
* Iceland no longer starts settled in earlier bookmarks. It must first be discovered and settled by the random events narrating the process. The millenium bookmark and later are unaffected by this.
* d_songhay is actually playable in 1060-1080 date range now
* Combat trait advancement for children now accounts for education changes in the Conclave DLC:: rowdy children, or children using the Martial education focus or Struggle childhood focus, now gain combat trait levels more quickly.	
* Automatic title distribution no longer requires your marshal to do but instead uses title decisions to raise/lower your banner. See in-game for more details.
* For the EU4C, Albanian and Anglo-Norse cultures should now properly convert
* For the EU4C, Eger should now properly convert from the correct CK2 province
* Fixed names in South Slavic group to be more authentic
* Fixed two Opole/Oppeln counties
* Fixed being unable to chage to Enatic-Cognatic succession
* Fixed Harald Hardrada being unable to abolish the Witan
* Expanded restrictions on provincial culture conversion to all religious titles which use papal succession mechanics.
* The Heritage focus may now ONLY be used if the child's educator is either not their culture or religion (since changing it is all the focus does).
* When using the 'Ask Permission for Heritage Focus' diplo-decision, the child's liege no longer automatically accepts unless you hold a favor on them (in which case the favor is used).
* The chances of the Heritage focus successfully changing culture and/or religion have been decreased.
