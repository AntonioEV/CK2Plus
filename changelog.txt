changelog 3.11.1

* Removed the CK2Plus loading screen. Added a banner on the title screen instead.
* All landless religion heads (other than Muslims, Catholic and Orthodox) may now be vassalized by a King or Emperor of their religion who owns a holy site.
* Gave a boost to the Yngling ruling Oppland in the CM start.
* The duchy of Alania is now a tributary to Khazaria in the CM start, not a vassal.
* Fixed Reformed Germanic Pagan religious head existing prematurely.
* Fixed map position for the middle province of the Rhine.
* Fixed the Seljuk dynasty tree.
* Fixes and Changes for the Kemetic and Atenic religions
	- The Paragon title is now granted to the enacter, rather than a random priest
	- Restored some missing event pictures
	- Fixed a bug preventing Atenics from restoring the Priesthood
	- Added province modifiers to track	the construction of Pyramids and Luxor temple
* Expanded the depth of non-Silk Road Trade Networks
	- 3 New Building Types added for Trade posts
		x Toll Booth and Customs House: Provides a flat tax income. Depending on the province, and the importance of the land or sea network involved, it may have either or both of these improvements available.
		x Trade Guilds: This late game improvement provides large boosts to the trade network itself. Due to their large starting wealth neither the Silk Road, nor African trade may build a guild.
		x Roads: This improvement provides a small boost to trade values in a network
* Yazidi have been updated as per the Heretic Pride mod. Yazidi now:
	- Have a pilgrimage decision to go to the holy site of Lalish
	- Have a "Circulate the Peacock" festival instead of a Grand Feast
	- Believe in reincarnation
	- Young men may be declared koasasa, a reincarnation of one of the Seven Archangels
	- The religion head is no longer a caliphate, and always exists
* Added cultural localization for tribal titles.
* Fixed the vanilla bug where Lord Spirituals of other religions from tribal or nomadic governments had no localization and were thus "Court Chaplain"s
* Removed most religious title localization from non-religious titles in favor of cultural localization. (there are a few intentional exceptions).
* The "Constantine's Return" Event should no longer spam fire.
* Circle of Druids added as an electorate system for the Celtic Archdruid.
* Council of Apostles added as an electorate system for the Manichaean Archegos.
* Polygamist fathers are no longer barred from being able to legitimize bastards on birth
* Updated Celtic Pagans (some additions from the Ancient Religions mod, some bugfixes). Added Red Dragon Knights holy order.
* Added new religion icons (thanks to Careful Plum).
* The Paragon of Virtue ambition now adds a Paragon trait.
* The Become Exalted ambition now adds an Exalted trait - this can be taken at four different levels of Exalted, based on rank and total Prestige acheived.
* Added the Prometheans and Cult of Titan as heresies for Hellenic Pagans.
* The Pontifex Maximus is now a religion head (for Hellenic Pagans) that is held by a priest, not the emperor. He is elected by the College of Pontiffs. A Hellenic emperor does have the ability to force him to abdicate, if he is their vassal.
* The Hungarian invasion in the Old Gods start once again settles Hungary upon success, leaving their old lands behind. This works for a non-Horse Lords start, and if the Hungarians are nomads then settling in Hungary via decision will have the same effect (the old lands do not remain nomadic, however -- they revert to tribal).
