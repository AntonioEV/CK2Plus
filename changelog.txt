changelog 3.04.2

* Changed Norse Religion to Nordic, Saxon to Germanic
* Fix for supply limits. Added in a base supply limit boast along with a tweak to the prosperity supply limits since adding them to buildings had no effect.
* Removed requirement to be king tier from "Create Israel" decision.
* Added tooltip for creating the k_israel title to note that it must have already been created via the decision.
* Re-enabled the Frankish Empire creation if Charlemagne DLC is active.
* "Create the Carolingian Empire" decision now allows for vassals to be kings of Germany/France/Lotharingia, if the ruler is the Frankish emperor.
* Themata system for Byzantine Empire now works if emperor is Hellenic or an Orthodox heretic.
* The Byzantinue-specific coronation now only applies if emperor is Orthodox and not the Ecumenical Patriarch. Under any other circumstance, the regular coronation system applies -- but the emperor will gain the Weak Basileus or Strong Basileus trait as per normal (as opposed to the Crowned trait). In that case, the decision on which one is made by the AI rather than the Ecumenical Patriarch.
* Fix to the inability to raise tribal organization to maximum
* Opened up regular feast events to more pagan religions which don't already have their own feasts
* Added in more Jewish,Nubian and Indian Retinues
* Removed more duplicate charaters
* Revised AI creation/joining factors for the independence faction (to compensate for culture_group bug)
