changelog 4.01.7

* Fixed claimant adventurers being able to send the target of their adventure a letter asking for support. Very cheeky of them, no?
* Fixed succession law factions so that, if the liege agrees to the ultimatum, the law on the title is actually changed.
* Fixed some localisation errors in events related to the succession law factions.
