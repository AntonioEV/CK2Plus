changelog 3.07.7

* The Lord Spiritual can now be female for ALL religions that allow female temple holders, instead of just some.
* All non-Muslim Lord Spirituals save for Lollards must now be either temple holders or have an ecclesiastical education.
* Waldensian bishops may not be Chancellors or Lord Treasurers.
* Cleaned up some of the cultural retinues
* Altered much of the de jure layout in Germany and Lotharingia. Of major note: Both the Duchy of Oldenberg and the Duchy of Brunswick are no longer de jure titles, replaced respectively by the Duchy of Westphalia and the Duchy of Eastphalia. Those both comprise the territory of the historical Duchy of Saxony, which is now eliminated as a de jure ducal title (but still exists as a kingdom-tier title). The Margraviate of Brandenburg added as a kingdom-tier de jure title, active in the 1066 start but previous to that formable if the HRE or one of its duchies gains complete control over Brandenburg and Meissen.
* Reformed Celtic pagans should no longer switch back to Tanistry after they change from it.
* Celtic children should no longer die in druidic training after training has completed.
* Celtic rulers using Offerings to the Sidhe can now have a (smaller) effect on whether provinces owned by direct vassals (or all vassals if top liege is using the decision) gain/lose the Restless Sidhe modifier.
* Using de jure CB's on behalf of your vassals when targeting a valid Holy War target now works once again.
* De jure CB's which cannot be used due to insufficient Crown Authority now display on your list of CB's, but are greyed-out with the reason given.
* Fixed viking invasion CB so it properly grants all occupied counties to the attacker again.
* Rebel reinforcement events should no longer fire on the same day as the original uprising.
* Fixed the "quietly kill him" option for the Kidnap plot to not kill the plotter.
* Updated Iconoclast heresy as per the Heretic Pride mod. Iconoclasts now have extra events, may destroy icons upon besieging a christian temple (and receive the Icon-Breaker trait), and receive a morale bonus for their armies. It is now also possible for an emperor besides the ruler of Byzantium to create an Iconoclast Patriarch.
* Restored the missing d_paulician title, and added its historical holders from founding through to 872 AD. In the 867 start, the Paulicians hold the county of Coloneia and have an army of zealots.
* Updated Paulician heresy as per the Heretic Pride mod. Paulicians now:
	- May raid, as pagans do
	- May declare Holy War on anyone not of the same religion
	- The Paulician Patriarch may declare Crusade against anyone not of the same religion
	- Receive a morale bonus and an offensive bonus for light infantry
	- May expend Piety to raise units of zealots
	- Can receive the Icon-Breaker trait after besieging a Christian temple
* Norse culture provinces should no longer randomly change culture when part of a norse empire
