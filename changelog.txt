changelog 4.01.7

* Fixed claimant adventurers being able to send the target of their adventure a letter asking for support. Very cheeky of them, no?
* Fixed succession law factions so that, if the liege agrees to the ultimatum, the law on the title is actually changed.
* Fixed some localisation errors in events related to the succession law factions.
* Fixed immediately invalidating Carolingian Imperial Reconquest wars.
* Added a Norman event chain for Rollo to invade or seize control of the Neustrian coast, and perhaps convert or eventually be subjugated.
* Seduction is now always limited by distance to the target, whether they're both in the same realm or not.
* Fixed liberation revolts from sometimes ending in revolting rulers going independent from their former liege.
* Upped lower-end prerequisites for sainthood, to make them less commonplace.
* New saints only add to a religion's MA if it's below 75%.
* Faction system revolts of rulers who are themselves vassals will no longer be invalidated.
* Merchant Republics overthrown by a regular faction will now always abdicate -- their title is never usurped.
* Religion heads who are theocracies and for whom the religion head title is their primary now lose all claims upon inheriting the title.
* Nationalist revolts now do not apply if the de jure kingdom title of the province where the revolt occurs has a holder in the same realm who is of the province's culture (regardless of whether the top liege does not).
* Claim All CB can now also include weak claims if they are usable when the CB is used.
* Extended the "6 German Duchies" requirement for HRE formation to include de jure Bavaria and Saxony, in case those were not included in the Carolingian Empire.
