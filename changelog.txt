changelog 4.02

* MAJOR: Compatibility with the 4.5.1.1 patch and the Conclave DLC. Most major new features should work as well as they do in vanilla (which is to say that they are fairly buggy at this point). Some major points of difference:
- The Infamy/Coalition feature is completely turned off, even if you have the DLC active.
- Shattered Retreats are active, but the distance of the retreat and the speed at which the armies moves during retreat is reduced. They regain morale at normal rather than accelerated rate.
- "Crown Authority" is retained, and works pretty much as it always did.
- Added a "Late Feudal Administration" law, which serves as a prerequisite for some succession types (such as Primogeniture).
- "Status of Women" law is not included, until such a time as we can figure out a better implementation.
- Only one of the new ambitions ("Build a War Chest") is available if you have the DLC active. None of the old ambitions have been removed, whether the DLC is active or not.
- Council voting is not yet optimized for the mod, and pretty much uses vanilla parameters at this point until we figure it out.
- Some of the new events are simply not active (like the horse chancellor), while others have been heavily tweaked. They will likely require more tweaking.
- The new child education focuses and events are untouched and currently completely vanilla.
- We would very much like to hear about bugs in 4.02, just remember that what you're seeing may be vanilla functionality and there's very little we can do to affect it. You may also find some weirdness with regards to the new Non-Aggression Pacts affecting how mod events are supposed to play out (in particular factions, since having a Non-Aggression Pact means you're locked out of the four interest factions -- that's hard-coded and we can't get around it, currently). We've tried to anticipate everything we can, but there's no way for us to foresee how all the systems will interact this early on, so more eyes are always better.
* Ransomed adventurers should now be properly imprisoned by their ransomer.
* Fixed the event text on the event which grants the administrator trait.
* The zealots raised by "Build Zeal" now remain if you are in a war with a primary attacker/defender of a different religion group or a heresy/parent of your own religion, not just for certain CB's.
* Religious/Heretic rebel uprisings now target the duchy of the province they began in, taking all same-religion provinces therein if they succeed (in addition to any provinces they occupy), rather than taking all same-religion provinces in the entire realm.
* The Grand Trunk Road trade network has been added to the Indian sub-continent
* German Empire should now be createable when the Supreme Patriarch is in Constantinople.
* Some Tamazight events and mechanics have been added.
* Roman provincia kingdoms may now be properly formed after they have been de jure established.
* Added a plot to elope with your unlanded female lover. Those who stand to inherit are more difficult to elope with.
* Changed so that the WoL foci will also lower one stat along with granting their normal bonuses
