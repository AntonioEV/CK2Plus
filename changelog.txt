changelog 3.08

* Characters created via the Ruler Designer should now properly receive the startup events (the Crowned trait, Byzantine initialization event, etc.)
* Coronations are now properly cancelled when a war occurs.
* Invasion CB now works against non-kingdoms. CB description updated to reflect what it actually does in Plus.
* Shi'a Caliphate Uprising revised: the uprising is now led by the current proper claimant to the Shiite Caliphate. If there is no such claimant (due to the Fatimids having been wiped out or converted), they will find a pretender much as in the current version -- though he will be an adult, and not a 3-year old child. If the uprising is successful, the new caliph's levies will be properly refilled (they are meant to do so in the CB, it just doesn't work) and he will receive an army of followers to establish his empire. Should the Caliphate be created prior to the uprising event, that new caliph will receive the army instead.
* Monks and nuns now receive the "Brother" and "Sister" title before their names, and will change their appearance (tonsure/robes for monks and a white hood for nuns).
* Lords/Ladies now receive the title before their name.
* Fixed the Paulician use of the Holy War CB on same-religion group targets.
* Yazidi religion is no longer localized as Salafi.
* Added some logic for where heresies appear -- they are more likely to show up in their historical areas (such as Catharism in southern France), and occasionally instead of a "heresy" the character/province may instead switch to another religion in the same religion group (such as a Sunni province embracing Shiia), though only where it's logical to do so. On the rare occasion, a potential heretic may embrace another religion group entirely, though again only where it's logical for that to occur (a Muslim may decide to become Manichaean, for instance, but only in Persia or Central Asia).
* Reduced piety loss for Cathars who have children, and removed the prestige loss entirely.
* Added a base -25% fertility for all Cathars.
* Cathars may now also use the adoption decision if they are over 45 or have less than 5% fertility.
* Added Adoptionist as a new Catholic heresy (no special mechanics).
* Added Tondrakian as a new Miaphysite heresy (no special mechanics yet, but they are feminist like the Messalians or Cathars).
* Added Quranist as a new Sunni heresy (no special mechanics, but they can only have 1 wife and can form a caliphate).
* Added Qarmatian as a new Shiite heresy (no special mechanics yet, but they can raid, receive an offensive bonus, and can form a caliphate).
* Manichaeism is no longer a Zoroastrian heresy, but rather a religion of its own within the same religion group. Zurvanism has been added as a Zoroastrian heresy, and Mandaean has been added as a Manichaean heresy.
* Updated the Manichaean faith, as per the Heretic Pride mod. Manichaeans now:
	- Have a religious head, which exists in the Charlemagne and Old Gods bookmarks, and can be restored afterwards.
