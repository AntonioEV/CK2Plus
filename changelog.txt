changelog 4.03.2

* Added Imperial Government type, automatically applied to feudal rulers who pass the Imperial Administration law (and all their feudal vassals). They must maintain the Religious Control Mandate and Regulated Inheritance laws or be reverted to Feudal Government. This is (currently) the same as Feudal Government, but with the added benefit of free revocation on all duchy and kingdom titles.
* Added a 'Women on the Council' law group under the Council laws tab. This determines whether the roles of women on the ruler's council can be expanded from the default, and at its highest level provides the prerequisite for Absolute Cognatic succession. The maximum level also establishes a realm's status as 'feminist' if passed, meaning that the normal opinion malus for a female ruler or female heir will be removed.
* Fixed matrilineal marriages from becoming disallowed when a new primary title is created.
* Female nomads created by the Ruler Designer now also get their primary title changed to Agnatic-Cognatic succession (after one day).
* Rulers without a crown law title (such as independent dukes) may now pass the Revoke Title laws without worrying about Crown Authority.
* Fabricated claims which were accidentally made super-cheap as of two versions ago have now been restored to their pricier, minimum costs.
* Fixed missing descriptions for some of the new trade post buildings.
* Negative events that occur during the Bogomilist formalization process now actually hinder the process rather than help it.
* Formalizing the Bogomilist faith now removes the 'Formalizing Bogomilism' character modifier from the ruler.
* Moved one of the Norse holy sites from Iceland to the western Isles since Iceland not populated in early bookmarks
* Fixed erroneous changing of province culture to liege culture via inappropriate assignation of 'Settle Tribe' steward job.
* Improved south slavic titles
