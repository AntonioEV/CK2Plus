changelog 4.04.0
* MAJOR: The vanilla viceroy system introduced with the Charlemagne DLC now no longer exists, and the viceroy realm laws can no longer be passed. Now, when dukes/kings in Imperial government realms (who themselves have Imperial government) either die or have their title usurped, their liege may decide whether to assent to the new holder. If they refuse, the new holder may simply elect to agree to the decision, offer a favor/bribe, or rebel. If they agree to the decision, then the emperor's council will offer up to three alternatives (which may include the new holder anyhow)...and the emperor can override this and take the title for themselves if they have enough Prestige.
* An Imperial liege may make an Imperial vassal's title inherited. This is a diplo-decision, making the vassal either Feudal or Iqta and giving them the same opinion modifier they would get if they had been granted their primary title(s) by the liege outright. The title is inherited like a normal title from that point onwards, until and unless it is ever usurped (or revoked by the liege). Note that when a ruler first passes Imperial Administration and switches to Imperial government type, ALL feudal/iqta vassals are considered to have their titles inherited in this manner.
* Vassals with Imperial government may never create kingdom titles and may only create titular duchies.
* There is now an Imperial Iqta government type, as well, which functions like Imperial government in all ways except it also has some of the features consistent with Iqta (holding temples, requiring piety to pass laws, etc.).
* MAJOR: map overhaul for the following regions: Africa and the Middle-East. Some areas have less provinces but their relative power should be relatively the same.
* Major history overhaul for West Africa, including a new culture; Songhai.
* Added the "Savanna" terrain type which is unique to the West African Region.
* Fixed a bug preventing Brugge from building the land-based trade route buildings.
* Bogomilists will now become theocracies once the religion is formalized, without needing to first be at war.
* The Magyar Invasion CB is no longer available to Hungarians outside of the actual bookmark invasion scenario.
* The 'Building Church of St. Bogomil' province modifier is now removed once the church is built.
* The date can no longer manually be moved forward from the 1000 AD bookmark, only from the 1066 AD bookmark (as in vanilla).
* Fixed government flavor file for Imperial governments.
* Added a setup option to start the game with "Ancient Religions" replacing default ones while leaving nations intact. This option will disappear, like other similar setup ones, after the first day of any bookmark.
* Fixed rare matrilineal marriage setting bug for titles created by event, but which only copy the owner's former primary title's laws after they are granted.
* Disabled the "Colonization of Iceland" event chain as the final colonization step proved too buggy to function as expected consistently.
* Moved the Rhine to where it should be
* Removed the Tyrant trait -- the tyranny opinion modifier added by defying your council could not be removed, sadly, so rather than have both the trait and the opinion modifier I've elected to simply get rid of the CK2Plus tyranny system completely. The effect of all diplo-actions such as imprisonment and banishment has been restored to vanilla values.
* Ruler designed nomads will no longer cause the nomadic realm to split because clans are unhappy about the new dynasty ruling.
* Increased maximum population for nomads received from empty holdings (and thus overall population growth).
