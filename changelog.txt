changelog 4.01.1

* Fixed being unable to build some trade post buildings.
* Fixed income gain from Toll Booths and Customs Houses.
* Re-localized Zikri back to its original name.
* Added spouse/consort conversion decision for Chalcedonian.
* The Paulician Patriarch no longer inherits the Antioch Patriarchate if they are not a theocracy.
* Religion head titles which are inherited/usurped, but belong to a different religion, are now either reverted back to their previous owner (if they're alive) or destroyed.
* Ineligible courtiers of the player will no longer get married.
* Added age customization traits for the Ruler Designer -- select them to reduce your starting age by a set amount, and they disappear once the game begins.
* If using the Ruler Designer, you can now select a "Customize Ruler Dynasty" trait, which will allow you to assign an existing character as a relative and assume their dynasty (only if you don't select the Bastard trait, however, in which case you keep your Ruler Designer dynasty but still get the relatives). This is only useable in the first 15 days of the game.
* The events which destroy Byzantium/HRE/Latin Empire due to having the wrong religion now create a custom empire title to replace it if you aren't eligible for the normal one, if no empire has been based on the kingdom of your capital already, and so long as you have a proper realm size to support it. The vassals which could possibly go independent as a result will only be those who are also de jure vassals of the destroyed title.
* Lombardy now has the vanilla flag rather than Italy's flag.
* Italy now has the proper title history for Lombardy in the Old Gods start and later.
* Duel Engine changes:
	-Instead of automatically being maimed, characters who take wounds while already wounded will lose some health. Any health lost this way will be regained over time after the battle (assuming the character lives long enough to recover). 
	NOTE: there remains a small chance of being maimed or made incapable by taking hits in duels.
	-Characters made incapable during a duel will automatically yield. Opponents may then choose what to do with them (kill them, take them captive, or, for battlefield duels, just leave them there.
	-AI characters that lose a round are inceasingly likely to yield as the fight goes on and/or as they lose more and more health.	
	-Martial score no longer directly affects the outcome of duels, it is now primarily driven by personal combat skill, personal combat traits, and other relevant traits. Martial education traits still have a small effect.
	-The events concluding holmgangs should no longer fire twice.
