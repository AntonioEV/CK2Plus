changelog 3.09.3

* Titular empire and kingdom titles that are supposed to be invalid with the Charlemagne DLC active are now made inactive instead, so they cannot be seen or even searched for. If you really want to, it is okay to make the DLC inactive and those titles will re-appear during the annual maintenance (as well as the reverse -- any titles which are held will not be made inactive during maintenance).
* Instead of making the "Form New Kingdom" and "Form New Empire" decisions disappear when you hold an invalid primary title, there is now a tooltip that tells you why.
* The "barren" modifier is now only added once a character gets married/becomes a consort, to prevent the AI from magically detecting it first.
* Updated tooltips on kidnap plot event so it doesn't display that you'll be killing yourself.
* Fixed Baloch, Sogdian and Tocharian characters from not getting retinues
* Added Sahidic (Coptic) culture for Egyptians who are also Coptic/Monophysite, using Arabic skin tone and features but eastern-style Christian garb (as well as Christian names for titles and holdings). Egyptian characters/provinces that become Coptic/Monophysite can become Sahidic, as well as the reverse.
* Monks & Nuns will now automatically become divorced when they gain the trait.
* Sons and daughters of estate holders now inherit them according to the liege's gender law.
* Added desert mothers and desert fathers for Coptics/monophysites -- they are wandering ascetic monks/nuns, and while they can become Chancellors or Lord Spirituals (and cannot lead armies), they will eventually move on to another court.
* Antipopes can no longer be targeted by the Accuse Heresy plot.
* Coptics, Apostolics, Nestorians, and Monothelites of high Learning (8+) now have the ability to embrace either the Alexandrine or Antiochian school of theology.
* Reorganized the bookmarks so they're in chronological order again.
* Merged in parts of "High Kings and Consuls"
* Blank event description for relatives requesting to become monks/nuns is fixed.
* Made the arrow indicating blocked trade more easily distinguishable from the unblocked one.
* AI will not fight to reclaim pentarchy temple holdings from patriarchs of the same realm and religion.
* Added Latin Patriarchates (duke-tier titles, same as the pentarchy titles) for Constantinople, Alexandria, Jerusalem, and Antioch should Catholics gain those temples.
* 'Mend the Great Schism' is now useable by Orthodox/Catholics heresies, provided they have a religion head, and also works against heresies, provided they have a religion head. It does not require that the same empire control all five Pentarchy sees, but rather that all the sees belong to the same religion. The user can be the religion head or any Empire that has the religion head as a vassal or owns one of the sees (and must still have sufficient piety, not to mention a religion with 90 MA).
* Once the Schism has been mended, there are now also similar decisions to 'Enforce the Council of Chalcedon' (against the Miaphysite religions) and to 'Enforce the Council of Ephesus' (against Nestorians).
* Nestorians have a decision to 'Repudiate the Council of Ephesus', turning Orthodoxy into a heresy, and may 'Enforce the Council of Chalcedon' once that has been done.
* Miaphysites have a decision to 'Repudiate the Council of Chalcedon', turning Orthodoxy and the other Miaphysite faith into heresies, and may 'Enforce the Council of Ephesus' once that has been done.
* Once Nestorians or Miaphysites have turned Orthodox into a heresy, they may use the 'Unite Christianity' decision against Catholicism in the same manner.
* All the 'mend schism' type decisions have been turned into a chain involving the creation of an ecumenical council, with the results making more sense and resulting in less flip-flopping of parents/heresies afterwards.
* Adjusted decadence gain for muslims.
