changelog 3.07.7

* Cleaned up some of the cultural retinues
* Altered much of the de jure layout in Germany and Lotharingia. Of major note: Both the Duchy of Oldenberg and the Duchy of Brunswick are no longer de jure titles, replaced respectively by the Duchy of Westphalia and the Duchy of Eastphalia. Those both comprise the territory of the historical Duchy of Saxony, which is now eliminated as a de jure ducal title (but still exists as a kingdom-tier title). The Margraviate of Brandenburg added as a kingdom-tier de jure title, active in the 1066 start but previous to that formable if the HRE or one of its duchies gains complete control over Brandenburg and Meissen.
