changelog 3.06.3

* Fixed spying event chain when you choose to immediately reveal your target's affair.
* Revamped adventurer code so they choose destinations a bit more realistically.
* Reduced AI use of castration/blinding.
* The AI will fight for claims of spouses and occasionally friends/lovers even if that doesn't mean they'll become vassals afterwards.
