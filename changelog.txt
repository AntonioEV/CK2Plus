changelog 3.06.5

* For the EU4 converter, religion icon strips updated for "El Dorado"
* Fixed de jure claims for vassals to work properly -- de jure claims may now be enforced on behalf of vassals so long as they hold a de jure title.
* Elective Gavelkind now requires a vote from your vassals in order to change the succession law, the same as Tanistry or Feudal Elective.
* Both Tanistry and Feudal Elective are now options for a ruler moving from Elective Gavelkind. Tanistry is available to tribals, as Gavelkind is.
* The cooldown for holy wars is now not added until after the war is resolved (in case it becomes invalid).
* The Carolingian Empire now begins as an Elective Gavelkind rather than a Feudal Elective title.
* Independence events for heirs (under elective gavelkind) or for vassals when the liege is over the vassal limit have been tweaked to make more sense. Independence cannot be declared if the ruler is a child, is imprisoned, or is incapable. The declaration also looks at whether independence will put them next to a larger neighbour who can declare holy war on them.
* Automated stat changes based on age groups have been tweaked, as per LordPeter's suggestion.
