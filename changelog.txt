changelog 4.01.4

* MAJOR: All former tax and levy laws are now changed to the demesne law system used by EMF -- namely an Obligations law for each holding type, and a "slider" that allows you to customize whether you'd like to focus on levies or taxes (or strike a balance between the two).
* MAJOR: Removed the Shattered World system and replaced it with the New World Order system from HIP (with their kind permission). It includes an Ancient Religions option, as Shattered World did.
* MAJOR: Through a long period of work with zijistark over at HIP, we've revamped the faction system to work a bit more seamlessly with less chance of revolts invalidating oddly and leaving former vassals independent. From the player side, the main change that you'll notice now is that these sorts of revolts (anything involving the four main factions, the Claimant faction, or the Independence faction) have a "call to arms" period where your liege's other vassals are invited to join over a period of 30 days. At the end of that period, you'll need to enact a decision to either start the civil war or make the ultimatum to the liege. If the liege refuses an ultimatum, the civil war is started automatically (there is no vote in the faction to determine whether or not to go to war). You'll note that the revolts now have ALL vassals in the unified revolt realm, as opposed to a revolt realm and a number of third-party independent revolter allies. The CB should now also properly display all the possible results of the war.
* Venice now playable in all bookmarks.
* Fixed Restore Themata System decision to properly increase Crown Authority by only one level.
* Patricians without county holdings now have more consistent access to the employment decisions.
* The AI will now not create a new dynasty when it is heir or pretender to a title held by a member of their current dynasty.
* Banishing a decadent dynasty member when there are no other rulers of your religion will now not result in them remaining in your realm.
* Fixed the decadence tooltip to not state that imprisoning a decadent dynasty will mean they don't count towards your decadence trait.
* Merchant Republics can no longer seize patrician family palaces through their CB.
* The decision to lay a claim on the Byzantine Empire should now be more visible to players, and now solely requires that the emperor not have the Strong Basileus trait.
* The Bogomilist religion head is now called an Elder, and is elected by a Council of Advisors filled by five Stroinik/Stroinitsa selected from those with the Perfectum trait.
* The Subjugation CB can now be used by non-tribal & non-nomadic rulers against de jure vassals who are either independent or part of the same realm, and who are either both of the same culture group and religion or who have previously become independent through rebellion or after a different rebellion has resulted in them breaking free (these now apply the 'Broke Vassal Contract' opinion modifier, inherited by heirs for the next 50 years, instead of providing claims to the former liege). It does not require that the Crown Authority of king and empire titles be first raised to Medium or above, as de jure claim wars do. If the target was one who became independent, the CB will not only re-vassalize them but also imprison them (and the 'Broke Vassal Contract' opinion will allow revocation/execution).
* When a minor clan rises in a nomad realm, the nomadic ruler will have the opportunity to simply give them the county and let them become a major clan in the realm rather than fight them.
* Changed name of Finnish pagan high priest/priestess.
* Revamped events for appearance of Genghis Khan -- Genghis will now definitely expand rapidly and not simply sit there with his troops.
* Fixed bugs related to the Zoroastrian decision "Make Great Sacrifice"
* Doubled the durations of modifiers for the Zoroastrian decision "Make Great Sacrifice"
* Fixed late-bookmark rulers for Lietuva and Lithuania
* The decision to create the Patriarch Supreme now can only be taken by an Emperor with 1500 Prestige, if it's not being taken by a Pope/Ecumenical Patriarch with sufficient Piety on their own.
* The Patriarch Supreme is now also granted the bishopric of Rome by an AI Chalcedonian ruler (with no player as a top liege), just as with the Pope.
* Fixed Paulician religion description localisation.
* The Paulician religion heads may no longer excommunicate.
* Nomads may now absorb tribal holdings held by a vassal chief in a province that is the same culture and religion (this destroys the holding).
* Increased the annual chance of the Spy Network rating being increased by a spymaster.
* Added some restrictions on where AI religion heads can declare crusades: the target must contain a holy site, have a province of that religion, or the de jure kingdom either contains a count belonging to that religion/one of its provinces neighbors one.
* You now have the option of immediately triggering the schism for Christians in any bookmark prior to 1054 on the first day of a new game. This will supplant Chalcedonians with Catholics and Orthodox appropriately. After the first day this option disappears.
* Bug fixed that prevented the selection of Novgorod as playable in 1221 and onwards.
* The First Academy religion head title may now be properly created by Promethean pagans.
* Patricians are no longer able to join independence factions.
* Fixed up a few remaining empire-tier titles which weren't updated to requiring either 150 realm size or 50 provinces in order to create them (as opposed to just 150 realm size).
* The Indian religious group no longer gets the 'wrong religion capital' modifier if their capital is of a different religion in the Indian group.
* Non-merchant republics/patricians that gain a province with a trade post which will push them past the trade post limit of the Trade Practices tech will now result in that trade post being removed.
* Fixed the sainthood events so they occur within a shorter timeframe, thus making it far less likely for the delayed event to simply be "lost" by the engine.
* The Norse invasions in the Old God bookmark given a bit of a boost.
* The "Ask For Embargo" diplomatic action has been disabled (since it does not follow the rules of the CB -- you can ask a liege to use the CB even when he is not valid to do so).
* Fixed a bug where women rulers/heirs were sometimes prompted to marry other women.
* When the Carolingian Empire is formed, rulers who have to give up lands to the Pope will now receive an event telling them why.
