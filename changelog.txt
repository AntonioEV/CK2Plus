changelog 3.07.5

* Added a bunch of tooltip to the new "Attempt Religious Conversion" diplo action which should give players a bit more insight into their options and chances of success.
* Fixed the Third Temple event so it shows the proper builder name, and added a boost to Jewish RA after it's built.
* Characters who are away from their home courts during war will have a lower chance of discovering plots and will be unable to have more children while they're away.
* If the holder of a caliphate rises above 80 decadence, other rulers of their religion (Dukes or greater) who have low decadence may claim the caliph title.
* Made lowering decadence as a muslim alittle bit easier ( tho it can still swing upwards quickly if not watched carefully ).
