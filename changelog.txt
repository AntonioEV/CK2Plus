* Jylland's Prepared Invasion of Mercia in 867AD now spawns troops based on target strength.

* Prepared Invasion CB is no longer considered a holy war.
* Moved most de jure kingdom CB's to the new region system (so they remain useable even if new de jure kingdoms appear).
* Beefed up the Shiia Revolt event slightly, and restricted it to certain geographical regions.
* AI muslims no longer go pagan (via the system of "pursuing ancient knowledge").
* Gave the Doge of Venice more gold at CM start.
* Reverted most of the balkans in the CM start to tribals.
* Revised the "introduce two friends" event chain so it makes more sense to the player what's actually happened.

* The HRE's initial creation will now rename West Francia if its renaming did not previously occur.
* Various factions now disapprove of high decadence.
* Increased attraction to the Separatist faction for vassals which are further away from the liege's capital.
* The victors in a separatist civil war also have the chance of losing control of distant/weakly-held territories after they separate.
* Fixed some counts beginning the game with a primary title not matching their capital.
* Faction anger over granting landed titles to non-faction members now specified in the opinion text.
* Added note of the above to the tooltip on factions.
* You will no longer receive the Recent Holy War cooldown if you engage in a holy war that is part of your de jure empire.
* Added a maintenance event to ensure patricians and merchant republics have the correct succession laws.
* The AI will no longer pass viceroy laws -- they are restricted to the ERE and players who wish to use them.
