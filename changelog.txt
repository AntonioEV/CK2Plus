changelog 3.06

* Major revision to the faction system:
	* There are now four main factions:
		Court (vassals who push for autonomy and recognition)
		Prosperity (vassals who are interested in wealth and peace)
		Glory (vassals who are interested in prestige and war)
		Tradition (vassals who are interested in piety and religion)
	* Vassals can join all four factions, but will be drawn to some based on their traits and relations with the faction leader
	* Faction leaders have a diplo decision to 'Recruit Faction Member' for any vassal not part of their faction
	* Faction members have a diplo decision to 'Court Faction Member' for any other member of their faction
	* Faction members sometimes have disputes with disliked faction leaders, which can end in them leaving the faction
	* Chancellors have a new 'Negotiate With Faction' result on their Improve Relations job, if they are on the province of a faction leader
	* Spymasters have a new 'Undermine Faction Member' result on their Uncover Plots job, if they are on the province of a faction member
	* Upon a faction meeting being called, members have the option to call for a vote of no confidence before the meeting can begin
	* Factions have a wider variety of things they can demand when they're unhappy, including reversion to an old succession law or surrendering a county to a faction member
	* 'Faction Mood' is no longer abstracted -- it is based directly on the prevailing opinion of faction members towards their liege
	* When a faction rebellion is defeated, rebels are banned from joining ANY faction for five years
	* Tooltips only indicate a change in faction mood when the liege actually has that faction existing
	* Actions that change faction opinions now last five years, rather than until the annual faction maintenance
	* Factions are pleased when you give a title to a member of their faction
* Faction rebellions now properly remove the Loyalist trait upon the war ending, and the "reward your allies" event should properly fire
* Lieges now get an opinion bonus towards Loyalist vassals, as well as the reverse, for the duration of the war
* Factions are no longer called into a Separatist war
* Pretender faction leaders have a diplo decision to 'Ask to Support Pretender' for any fellow vassal, to get them to support your chosen pretender
* There is now a "Religious Faction" which can form if a vassal is part of the liege's religion group but not the same religion (meaning they are either a heretic or the parent religion). If the faction grows powerful enough, it will demand that the liege convert or will start an overthrow war -- and if that war is successful, the liege will be replaced by an heir/pretender/claimant of the faction's religion or by the faction leader.
* band-aid fix to prevent Carolingian Empire/Holy Roman Empire from gaining de jure territories before they have ever been formed
* fix to France becoming de jure e_france again after the fall of the Carolingian Empire
* fix to prevent carousing from cancelling for "no guests" when invitees have accepted.
* fix to allow the Restless Sidhe modifier to go away from provinces no longer held by Celtic Pagans or Tuatha
* Upped the impact diseases have on the provinces they infect ( effects against charaters remains unchanged)
* Pagan Subjugation CB no longer restricted to neighbors (still restricted to targets in the de jure kingdom of your capital, though)
* Egyptian, Levantine and Bedouin cultures now properly convert in the EU4 Converter
* Several omitted & incorrect provinces have been addressed in the EU4 converter
* Added "the Jailer" for rulers who enjoy having a rather populated prison
* Centralization law removed -- Vassal limits and demesne size modifiers moved to Crown Authority (+12 vassal size at minimum CA with -3 per level down to 0 at max, +0 demesne size at minimum CA with +1 per level up to +4 at max)
* Majesty conveys a bonus to demesne size, with +1 at tech level 2, +2 at tech level 4, +3 at tech level 6 and +4 at tech level 8
* Customs techs now convey a levy bonus as well as a tax bonus
* Adjusted de jure land in and around finland
* Unreformed pagans can now convert to feudalism/republicanism
* Titles that are invalid due to the Charlemagne DLC being active will now reflect that in the tooltip
