changelog 3.11

* MAJOR: fixed a crashing bug associated with unlanded rulers holding grant hunts.
* MAJOR: removed the New Millenium bookmark
* May no longer enforce claims for Muslim women who are not themselves rulers.
* Added check for Muslims without the proper succession law to the annual maintenance event.
* Added event to prompt the lazy AI to use the Manifest Destiny CB to get to the Carolingian Empire creation requirements.
* Fixed Sahidic culture appearance.
* The patriarchate titles are now only gained if the top liege is a King or Emperor (so the holder won't suddenly become independent).
* Plugged a bunch of vanilla "holes" in the India history files, the ones that were mistakes and not simply omissions.
* Fixed tooltip for banish to reflect the new vanilla function.
* The Grand Duchy of Tuscany can now be formed by Italians as well as Germans.
* All titular title which can be formed by Italians can now also be formed by Lombards.
* Duel Engine: Successfully fleeing should no longer get a combatant captured anyway.
* Duel Engine: Reduced chance of battlefield duels to account for lower number of potential commanders in 2.4.
* Added Messalian religion head, so the patriarchs will properly display. The Patriarch of Antioch will automatically become the Messalian religion head.
* Edited tooltips for Pentarchy to mention that religions which only recognize the Petrine Sees will get three Patriarchs, not five. Added tooltips to those religions.
* All provinces which have an uprising will now get the "Recent Uprising" modifier, reducing revolt risk in that province by 100% for five years.
* The 'Raise Zealots' decision for Paulicians and Kharijites now works properly again.
* Muslims have a much lower chance of using Holy War against Ibadi, as well as the reverse.
* Nomad subjugation now costs prestige to use.
* Rivalry CB is also available against foes (same targets as duels) as well as those who are targeting you or a family member with a murder plot.
* Non-nomadic AI will no longer use the tributary CB against targets of a different religion group.
* Unlanded religion heads can no longer call crusades.
* The Jewish religion head no longer exists at game start.
* Building the Third Temple and restoring the Jewish high priesthood are now one decision -- by building the Third Temple, the Jewish religion gains its religion head. It now requires that a Jewish King or Emperor completely controls Jerusalem, which itself must be Jewish.
* Tributary wars can no longer be declared on targets of equal or higher rank.
* The Become Exalted ambition now grants an Exalted trait and not a modifier.
* Russian melting pot events now require the East Slavic ruler to have a province of any OTHER East Slavic or Norse culture. They won't spontaneously become Russian on their own.
* The Druze heresy has been updated as per the Heretic Pride mod. Druze now:
	- May use 'Study Esoteric Knowledge' ambition to ascend to Uqqal (Initiate) status
	- Pious Uqqal may ascend to Ajawid status
	- Pious or charismatic Druze may invade fellow Muslims with the same criteria as the Prepared Invasion CB
	- A pious Ajawid may become the Druze Shaykh religion head
	- If the Druze acquire a religion head, it will no longer be a heresy
	- Believe in reincarnation
	- May not go on Hajj
	- Do not use the decadence system
	- Are restricted to one wife
	- Do not have restrictions on female councillors
