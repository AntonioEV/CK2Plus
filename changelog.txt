changelog 3.03

* Pretender factions now issue an ultimatum to the ruler rather than instantly declaring war.
* In a pretender war, the other vassals are individually asked to support the claimant rather than it being up to the faction leaders.
* The AI will not start a pretender war until it is at least at 75% faction strength, but now does not require any additional supporters if it has enough strength on its own.
* Jewish refugees should be slightly more reliable in their appearance.
* Fixed dynasties for Sardinian and Galloway rulers.
* Switched the locations of Tregor and Porhoet.
* Navarra now begins the game as Pamplona, switching to Navarra in 1076 (there is an event to switch the name in-game).
* Players may now choose to voluntarily call faction meetings without waiting for the event to prompt it.
* Restored the proper faction icons.
* Rewards to supporters after a civil war now specifically only penalize rulers who opposed the rulers or those who consciously elected to remain neutral -- not those who did not get a chance to decide (because they were imprisoned or incapable) or who otherwise did not receive the choice event. Penalties for those who remained neutral are roughly half the penalties applied to those who opposed the ruler.
* Added a Treaty of Meerssen event chain, should the Carolingian emperor inherit both Lotharingia and Burgundy. The rulers of West Francia and East Francia will demand a redistribution of the lands.
* Migrated the Hellenic Cults to event modifiers
* Added a maintenance event to remove the patron deities from those who convert away from hinduism and remove the cults from those who convert away from hellenism
* All independent, non-tribal kings and emperors are now "uncrowned" prior to holding a coronation event -- whereupon they become "crowned" (or "crowned by the pope", in the case of the HRE and Carolingian Empire) and are able to change crown laws. Being uncrowned also means their title can still be claimed via weak claims, even if they're an adult male. The coronation event is an event chain in itself, starting with invitations to the event (which go out to those in the realm as well as allies and neighboring rulers of your religion) as well as a great feast that follows.
* Fixed "Weaken Fellow Vassal" plot so the results do not break when your liege is not also your top liege.
* Fixed crash bug caused by AI-led angry faction being strong enough to present demands to the liege, but having no valid demands, and ending up in a loop.
* Tweaked calculations for vassals separating from the Carolingian Empire. Also changed requirements for forming the HRE: it cannot be the former emperor, and they must have either 100 provinces or 10 East Francia duchies.
