changelog 3.04.1

* Made the zoroastrian heresies properly hidden like the others
* Fixed maintenance event so it takes feudal elective into account and doesn't switch rulers over to something else
* Kipchaks switched to Elective Gavelkind from Tanistry
* AI ambition success results no longer show timer modifier being removed
* Standardized the Charlemagne "Create Empire" and "Create Kingdom" decisions to be in-line with standard CK2+ costs
* Opened up regular coronation decision to non-Orthodox rulers of the Byzantine Empire
* Fixed seniority succession for merchant republic non-primary titles
* Tribal invasion CB no longer available to reformed pagans who are not part of a horde culture
* The 5-year restriction on Holy Wars no longer applies if you hold the targeted Duchy title or are its de jure liege. There is a text notification that tells you whether the timer will apply or not.
* Fixed temple-building event so it properly only scopes to provinces without existing temples.
* Kama now has a severe winter.
* Changed a number of provinces in Eastern Europe to tribal or to stay tribal longer.
* The Pagan Subjugation CB may now only be used against targets that are de jure part of the same kingdom as your capital. It may only be used by rulers of king tier if they hold the kingdom title being subjugated. Having the "Become a King" ambition once again allows a ruler to use the CB more than once in their lifetime, and there is a tooltip which explains this.
