changelog 3.06.5

* For the EU4 converter, religion icon strips updated for "El Dorado"
* Fixed de jure claims for vassals to work properly -- de jure claims may now be enforced on behalf of vassals so long as they hold a de jure title.
* Elective Gavelkind now requires a vote from your vassals in order to change the succession law, the same as Tanistry or Feudal Elective.
* Both Tanistry and Feudal Elective are now options for a ruler moving from Elective Gavelkind. Tanistry is available to tribals, as Gavelkind is.
* The cooldown for holy wars is now not added until after the war is resolved (in case it becomes invalid).
