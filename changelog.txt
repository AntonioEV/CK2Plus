changelog 3.01

* expanded Carolingian Empire in 867 to its actual borders
* whenever the Carolingian title changes hands, provided it's at low or no CA, there's a chance that disaffected vassals will declare independence. They are less likely to do so if closely related to the new emperor or of the same dynasty. If the resulting empire becomes too small, then the Carolingian Empire disbands and the title becomes inactive -- opening up creation of the HRE.
* restored the king titles of Lotharingia, Italy, and Burgundy for the 867 start, which weren't being used
* added setup event for Carolingian Empire in 867 to simulate the rivalries between the kings in the empire
* made Sardinia its own de jure kingdom separate from Italy
* added an austerity system for the AI, so under certain conditions (has a loan, at war with a stronger enemy, has a king or duchy title they are eligible to form) they will be restricted from spending money on lesser expenses like buildings or events; when the AI is saving up, they will hit up vassals for money in the same manner as if they were bankrupt; the AI will now only take loans if they are at war with someone who has a higher title, any of their realm provinces are occupied, they are at negative wealth, or they are saving up for an important expense
