changelog 3.07.5

* Added a new "Imperial Decadence" system which affects all non-Muslim empires (and replaces the "State of the Empire" modifiers for the Byzantium). This is a variable between 0 and 100 which will increase by 3 or more (the amount gets higher the larger and more centralized the empire is) each time the title changes hands. As the variable gets above 10, the ruler will receive an Imperial Decadence modifier which reduces troop morale, levies, and global taxes by an amount that increases as the variable does. Imperial Decadence raises further if the empire loses wars or has a ruler/regent with negative traits (on a random basis). Imperial Decadence can be lowered through coronations, tournaments, winning wars (major rebellions, holy wars, crusades, and de jure imperial claims), and the ruler/regent having positive traits (on a random basis). There is also a Lower Imperial Decadence decision available every five years which can pass reforms to reduce the decadence variable, but at the cost of 1000 Prestige and 100 Piety. Some realms, like Byzantium, will begin the game with levels of Imperial Decadence already in place -- all other empires build it up as time goes on.
* Added a bunch of tooltip to the new "Attempt Religious Conversion" diplo action which should give players a bit more insight into their options and chances of success.
* Fixed the Third Temple event so it shows the proper builder name, and added a boost to Jewish RA after it's built.
* Characters who are away from their home courts during war will have a lower chance of discovering plots and will be unable to have more children while they're away.
* If the holder of a caliphate rises above 80 decadence, other rulers of their religion (Dukes or greater) who have low decadence may claim the caliph title.
* Made lowering decadence as a muslim alittle bit easier ( tho it can still swing upwards quickly if not watched carefully ).
* If an emperor gains a second imperial title, he will now be forced to choose between them. There can be only one empire.
* Tweaked the cannibal modifier.
* Allowed Old Saxon culture to form the Kingdom of Saxony.
* Bug fixed when enacting the "Rebuild Persepolis" decision at more than max number of holdings for the province.
* Merchant Republics now begin the game with more money, and access to additional starting forces and retinue cap through their palace.
* Small Merchant Republics (under 30 realm size) can summon their patricians to the republic's defence if they are attacked by an outside force.
* All holy orders will now ask to build a castle in an applicable ruler's province when they gather 600 gold. They only ask to build in provinces that already have all three main holding types (castle, city, temple), will not build more than one castle in the same province, and a given ruler can only be asked this once in their lifetime.
