changelog 4.01.6

* The new CB's added since the HL expansion have been updated to provide success for the 'Win a War' ambition, and to properly adjust Glory faction opinions.
* Fixed major river crossings that weren't updated when the Rhine was moved back to its original vanilla placement on the map.
* The events adding and removing the Restless Sidhe modifier have been moved to the notification box, similar to general province prosperity events.
* The event for improving the combat traits of children now fires much less often if the ward already has a higher level combat trait than the guardian does.
* Fixed votes to remove a faction leader so that the faction leader votes against his removal, rather than for.
* Fixed "building destroyed" siege event so it should no longer have the chance to destroy a building in the besieger's capital.
* Made Cyprus its own de jure kingdom, to prevent Greece from being considered "adjacent" to the Levant for jihad purposes.
* Removed vanilla Honest trait event chain which had no localisation.
* Lowered the multiplier on the AI's evaluation of marriage Prestige Effects.
* Capital of k_pontus moved to Sinope.
* The first leader for many holy orders will no longer have no traits.
* Claimant adventurers will now start with a title, rather than gaining one only when they begin the war. The difference this makes is that their target can plot against them without them constantly moving to different courts. They still "travel" around, approaching different rulers for support -- the difference is that they now do this solely by event, rather than by actually moving to the ruler's court. The claimant adventurer loses the title should they ever gain a different one, or if they should otherwise abandon the adventure. It cannot be inherited, even if the claim war has begun.
* Vassals can only use the holy war cb against targets bordering/near their demesne provinces (or the demesne provinces of their own vassals), not any province in their liege's realm.
* Paulicians are no longer eligible targets for excommunication events.
* Revamped some of the duchy adventurer conditions so their targets make more sense.
