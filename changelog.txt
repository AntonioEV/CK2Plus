changelog 4.01.2

* Byzantine Subjugation CB now requires a CA of Medium or higher. It also now targets a de jure duchy, and if the holder of the duchy (or counties within the duchy, if the duchy has no holder) has no counties outside of the needed regions they will be vassalized. If they do hold counties outside the region, or are Emperor-tier, the duchy will be usurped instead.
