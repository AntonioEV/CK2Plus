changelog 4.01.8

* Implemented a 'Taifa Vassals' demesne laws for muslim kings and emperors in Iberia, which will make their vassals more prone to want independence until the laws are changed.
* All Chalcedonian priests may now not marry. The system whereby priests with Greek Rites could retain their spouse was simply too buggy.
* English CoA's will now be set to their proper version upon loading a save (it may be wrong in the title screen, but will set properly upon entering the game). This will not retroactively fix old saves with this issue.
* Updated Roman/Byzantine province-creation events to be decisions instead, so you can see the requirements before the province is created. You will see decisions for each province once your realm has any counties in or neighboring the province's region.
