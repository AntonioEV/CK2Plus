changelog 3.07.6

* Bavaria/Saxony kings (and ducal vassals) no longer become independent when the Carolingian Empire is formed by a Frankish emperor.
* Patrician mansion holdings are no longer given out with the automated "give out holdings" decision.
* The "Found Merchant Republic" and "Adopt Feudalism" decisions are both now visible to players from the outset.
* The automated decisions to ransom prisoners are now only visible if you actually have prisoners (they previously appeared if some of your courtiers were held prisoner by others).
* Decadence may now occasionally increase if a muslim emperor has a very large realm, regardless of their other traits.
* Added a new type of revolter: decadence uprising, which can occur under a muslim ruler with 50+ decadence and in provinces with the "decadence unrest" province modifier (which can occasionally appear in provinces under a top liege with high decadence). This works the same as other revolters, with victory establishing a new realm under the revolter's rule.
* AI female tribal rulers no longer have access to the "Convert to Temple" decision if they are part of a religion that doesn't allow female temple holders.
* Fixed Muslim religion heads switching to Open Elective when the religious title is their primary one.
* Fixed "Blackmail Plotter" diplo-action so the player can properly receive the target's response.
* Fixed up events involving druidic training for Celtic pagans, so it's a bit more reliable in terms of finishing the event chain.
* The Kharijite heresy has been updated with a conversion of events used in the Heretic Pride mod. Kharijites now:
	- Have no 5-year cooldown on Holy Wars (it always costs 100 Piety for them)
	- May expend 250 Piety to raise zealot armies, in the same fashion that tribals use Prestige
	- Have access to the Public Execution diplo action, usable on prisoners who are either kafir or non-Kharijites, giving prestige and piety (based on the prisoner's importance)
	- May accuse immoral vassals of apostasy (and be accused), making them kafir (and giving a large negative to opinions from other Kharijites)
	- Kafir have access to decisions to remove immoral traits, and thus clear their name of apostasy
* The Cathar heresy has been updated with a conversion of events used in the Heretic Pride mod. Cathars now:
	- Cannot use the Holy War cb until Holy War or Crusade has been used by a Catholic against a Cathar
	- May create the Cathar Papacy
	- Have access to the Consolamentum decision to make themselves Perfectum
	- Perfectum/Celibate Cathar rulers may adopt an heir
	- May not choose the Seduction or Family focus
	- Have lowered garrison and levy sizes, but higher morale
	- Have an event to spawn their creation in southern France in the early 12th century
* The Lollard heresy has been updated with a conversion of events used in the Heretic Pride mod. Lollards now:
	- Lollard bishops may marry
	- Can gain the Icon-Breaker trait by sacking Christian temples
	- Have a decision to translate the Bible, increasing their MA and reducing Catholic MA
	- May freely revoke titles of priests who are non-Lollard or who have the Wicked Priest trait
	- May gain strong claims to Lollard priests who have titles of Duke rank or higher
	- May freely renounce vows of chastity or the monk/nun trait
* Integrated the New Duel Engine and Combat Trait Advancement, reduced the frequency of nameless vanilla battle deaths/woundings/maimings/brainings accordingly.
* Most heresies are now allowed in the character designer.
* Fixed global flags being set in the history files (effects Hungary creation, plus a few other minor things).
* Many updates to the EU4 Converter
	- Many titles, such as the stem duchies of the HRE, have now been properly assigned to their EU4 equivalent
	- Due to a recent fix in the converter many titles are now assigned to their proper CK2+ analogies, instead of CK2
	- Updated for EU4 version 1.12 (Common Sense Patch)
	- Ibadi now actually converts to the EU4 form of Ibadi
	- Rio de Janeiro should no longer be improperly assigned to someone in Europe
