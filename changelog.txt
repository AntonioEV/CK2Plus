changelog 3.05.3

* Unreformed Pagans can once again declare conquests on rulers outside of their religion group
* Added properly changing CoAs for various English titles for bookmarks (mostly between Norman and Saxon), courtesy of Polskers
* Added in Afghan cultural retinues
* Restored kidnap plot
* Restored seduce plot to non-playable characters (or by those who don't have the Way of Life DLC)
* Altered the "Spy On" decision available through the Way of Life DLC. It now has the following possible effects:
	- it can discover plots
	- if your target is also the target of your plot (or a plot you support), your plot can get extra Plot Power and will trigger more quickly
	- if your target has a "real father", you can discover this and either blackmail the father or reveal the truth
	- if your target has a lover, you can discover this and either blackmail either party or reveal the truth
	- you can enflame a rivalry between two rulers who don't like each other
	- you can reduce relations between a character and their liege
	- you can spread rumors about your target
	(in other words, no more free murder/kidnap/fabricate treason actions)
