* Pretender factions now issue an ultimatum to the ruler rather than instantly declaring war.
* In a pretender war, the other vassals are individually asked to support the claimant rather than it being up to the faction leaders.
* The AI will not start a pretender war until it is at least at 75% faction strength, but now does not require any additional supporters if it has enough strength on its own.
* Jewish refugees should be slightly more reliable in their appearance.
* Fixed dynasties for Sardinian and Galloway rulers.
* Switched the locations of Tregor and Porhoet.
* Navarra now begins the game as Pamplona, switching to Navarra in 1076 (there is an event to switch the name in-game).
* Players may now choose to voluntarily call faction meetings without waiting for the event to prompt it.
* Restored the proper faction icons.
