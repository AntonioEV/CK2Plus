changelog 4.04.0

* Major map overhaul for the following regions: Sub-saharan west Africa, Mesopotamia, East Africa, Arabia. Some areas have less provinces but their relative power should be relatively the same.
* Major history overhaul for West Africa, including a new culture; Songhai.
* Fixed a bug preventing Brugge from building the land-based trade route buildings.
* Bogomilists will now become theocracies once the religion is formalized, without needing to first be at war.
* The Magyar Invasion CB is no longer available to Hungarians outside of the actual bookmark invasion scenario.
* The 'Building Church of St. Bogomil' province modifier is now removed once the church is built.
* The date can no longer manually be moved forward from the 1000 AD bookmark, only from the 1066 AD bookmark (as in vanilla).
* Fixed government flavor file for Imperial governments.
* Added a setup option to start the game with "Ancient Religions" replacing default ones while leaving nations intact. This option will disappear, like other similar setup ones, after the first day of any bookmark.
* Fixed rare matrilineal marriage setting bug for titles created by event, but which only copy the owner's former primary title's laws after they are granted.
* Disabled the "Colonization of Iceland" event chain as the final colonization step proved too buggy to function as expected consistently.
