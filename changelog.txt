changelog 3.09

* Stripped out some maintenance calculations and features to lower the memory overhead for the mod. The most noticeable one from a player side would be the removal of the "isolated from capital" modifiers.
* Expanded the Trade Network.
	- The Silk Road has been expanded
	- The following Trade Networks have been added:
		x "Amber Road" This land route extends from Novgorod to Venice and Contanstinople
		x "Mediterranean Trade" This mostly sea based trade network expands out of Constantinople, Antioch and Alexandria and reaches as far as the Straits of Gibraltar
		x "Balkan Road" This mostly land based trade network expands out of Constantinople and covers much of the Balkan
		x "Salt Road" This mostly land based trade network expands out of Lubeck and Hamburg and covers most of Germany
		x "French Trade" This land based trade network expands from the north of France and streches into Barcelona and Lombardy via Paris
		x "Iberian Trade" This land based trade network expands from south western France and Barcelona into the corners of the Iberian sub-continent
		x "Atlantic Trade" This sea based zone encompasses the British Isles as well as the French and Iberian coastlines
		x "British Trade" This land based zone encompasses Britain from London and Winchester to Fife
		x "Baltic Sea Trade" This sea based zone encompasses the Baltic
		x "Timbuktu Trade" This land area encompasses sub-Saharan West Africa and leads into Morocco
* Bogomilism has been updated as per the Heretic Pride mod. Bogomilists now:
	- have an event for Bogomil's appearance in Bulgaria, if Tyrnovo has become Orthodox
	- feudal rulers may have temple holdings as well as castles
	- may use the Consolamentum decision to become Perfecti
	- may use the adoption decision, as the Cathar do
	- may gain the Icon-Breaker trait by sieging Christian temples
	- occasionally spawn missionaries in neighboring non-Bogomilist courts
	- are anti-church and anti-feudal at the outset, but may reform their faith through a series of laws and decisions to the point of allowing temple holders to once again be bishops and to have a religion head
	- once a religion head is gained, Bogomilism will no longer be an Orthodox heresy but its own religion in the Christian group
	- may not have Perfecti in government positions until the religion has been sufficiently reformed
	- may build the Church of St. Bogomil once the religion has been sufficiently reformed
