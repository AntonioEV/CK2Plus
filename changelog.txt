changelog 3.09.1

* Stripped out some maintenance calculations and features to lower the memory overhead for the mod. The most noticeable ones from a player side would be the removal of the "isolated from capital" modifiers and the "away from court" character modifier when leading an army.
* Expanded the Trade Network.
	- The Silk Road has been expanded
	- The following Trade Networks have been added:
		x "Amber Road" This land route extends from Novgorod to Venice and Contanstinople
		x "Mediterranean Trade" This mostly sea based trade network expands out of Constantinople, Antioch and Alexandria and reaches as far as the Straits of Gibraltar
		x "Balkan Road" This mostly land based trade network expands out of Constantinople and covers much of the Balkan
		x "Salt Road" This mostly land based trade network expands out of Lubeck and Hamburg and covers most of Germany
		x "French Trade" This land based trade network expands from the north of France and streches into Barcelona and Lombardy via Paris
		x "Iberian Trade" This land based trade network expands from south western France and Barcelona into the corners of the Iberian sub-continent
		x "Atlantic Trade" This sea based zone encompasses the British Isles as well as the French and Iberian coastlines
		x "British Trade" This land based zone encompasses Britain from London and Winchester to Fife
		x "Baltic Sea Trade" This sea based zone encompasses the Baltic
		x "African Trade" This land area encompasses sub-Saharan West Africa and leads into Morocco
* Bogomilism has been updated as per the Heretic Pride mod. Bogomilists now:
	- have an event for Bogomil's appearance in Bulgaria, if Tyrnovo has become Orthodox
	- feudal rulers may have temple holdings as well as castles
	- may use the Consolamentum decision to become Perfecti
	- may use the adoption decision, as the Cathar do
	- may gain the Icon-Breaker trait by sieging Christian temples
	- occasionally spawn missionaries in neighboring non-Bogomilist courts
	- are anti-church and anti-feudal at the outset, but may reform their faith through a series of laws and decisions to the point of allowing temple holders to once again be bishops and to have a religion head
	- once a religion head is gained, Bogomilism will no longer be an Orthodox heresy but its own religion in the Christian group
	- may not have Perfecti in government positions until the religion has been sufficiently reformed
	- may build the Church of St. Bogomil once the religion has been sufficiently reformed
* Fixed army movement to Kilkenny.
* Fixed formation of Hungary via the war at the Old Gods start.
* Fixed nomadic Magyars settling in Hungary so it properly gives them the k_hungary title.
* Fixed tribal vassals so they can properly go feudal if under a non-tribal liege.
* Fixed Italian dlc portraits not showing
* Allowed West Africans to raid heathens reguardless of their religion.
* Fixed negative decadence effects.
* Fixed d_galicia not being de jure k_spanish_galicia in the CM and OG starts.
* Changed the disease outbreak chance to match vanilla's.
* Fixed Makedon dynasty in the OG start.
* Opened up a number of minor titles to women based on ability to hold court positions or succession law, as appropriate.
* Fixed bug that was overly narrowing who could be given the Commander title.
* Fixed freezing problem when a nomad tries to settle -- any non-nomad king vassals have their titles usurped, and the duchy of the province being settled in also is usurped if held in the realm.
* Fixed CTD in the "Shattered Realm" decision
* The "Shattered Realm" decision now factors in Nomads properly for all cases
* Fixed unreformed Pagans being unable to feudalise or become republics.
* Norman culture creation events which happen prior to 1150 now happen if the province ruler is Norman or Norse, no matter who their liege is.
* Made Alania tribal at game start rather than nomad.
* De jure changes in Sweden: c_viken moved to d_ostlandet, c_medelpad and c_halsingland moved to d_uplland, d_jamtland moved to k_norway.
* Trade Networks now have an arrow indicating directional indicators as to which way they flow at the end of many paths.
* Changed color of Hungary, so it doesn't exactly match Magyars (since Magyars will still exist when Hungary is formed).
* Added a holding decision which allows the player to remove non-capital holdings from the province. Requirements: you personally own the holding, the county, AND the duchy, there is at least one other holding of that type in the province, you are not at war, and the province does not have the "chaos" modifier which is added after conquering it. The AI will not use this, period.
* "Holes" in the roman empire plugged
