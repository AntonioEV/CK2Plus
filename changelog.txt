changelog 4.01.3

* MAJOR: Nomad rulers with 25+ realm provinces and 4+ demesne provinces who die with at least two adult, capable sons will now split the clan between them (amongst up to four sons, depending on the realm size). The sons not inheriting the main title may choose to split off and become independant, and neighboring clans may choose to join them. To reduce border gore, provinces which are not connected by land to either the realm capital or the capital of a nomadic vassal will be usurped by one of the sons who has a neighboring province.
* Nomad realms may now have up to 12 clans, and the ideal size for each clan has been reduced slightly.
* Nomad rebellions won't be started by the AI for the first two years of the game, like the other rebellions.
* Forts are now free, but take 60 days to build (instead of 20) and have a much smaller garrison.
* Empty provinces now require 50 soldiers to occupy (instead of 100).
* If a new nomadic khagan is of a different dynasty than the last one, there is a chance that their clans will decide to split off on their own (the chance is based on their clan opinion of you, as well as your relative power to each other, in addition to their personal traits). If they split off, you will get a strong but not inheritable claim on all their counties.
* Tributaries are automatically inherited if a ruler abdicates or his title is passed off to another after a succession crisis.
* Extra daughters for early bookmarks now appear at the start again (instead of after one day) and still have randomized traits.
* The Shattered Realm decision will no longer make bunch of clone characters. After all decisions have been made the game must be run at speed 1 for exactly one day, then paused to allow the game to catch up on generating the characters.
* Tweaked the initial distribution of duel engine combat traits to include martially-educated courtiers as well as landed rulers.
* Battlefield duels should now more consistently impact the morale balance of the battle.
* Fixed the Settle Province job action for nomadic stewards.
* Winter supply reductions have been halved, to match the halving of the base supply limit.
* Players will no longer be included in the "extra daughters for early bookmarks" function.
* The "Saint" and "Martyr" nicknames will no longer be gained except on death, through the sainthood system.
* The "Recent Uprising" province modifier added by Peasant, Decadence, and Minor Clan revolts now lasts 10 years instead of 5.
* Religious, Heretic, and Liberation revolts now give you the option of dealing with the province where they originated, once the war is over. You can "teach them a lesson", giving you +1 tyranny and adding a harsh penalty to taxea and levies for five years but extending the "Recent Uprising" modifier to ten years and giving a 25% chance of converting religion/culture (depending on the uprising type), "force them to convert" which gives you +2 tyranny and harsher penalties, but the "Recent Uprising" modifier lasts twenty years and there is a 50% chance of conversion, or you can opt to find a more peaceful solution (ie. do nothing).
* Trade network roads now increase movement speed of armies dependant on rank
* Patricians without county holdings should now be able to join factions.
* Fixed the province of Oland.
