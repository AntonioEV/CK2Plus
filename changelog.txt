changelog 4.01

* Fixed formation of the Carolingian Empire to refer to k_lombardy rather than k_italy, and now actually requires control of Bavaria.
* Added Chalcedonian support to the EU4 converter
* Monophysites, Nestorians and Massalians should now properly convert in the EU4 converter
* Naturally-born children should no longer think their father is their uncle.
* Feudal pagans will no longer have their succession type revert to gavelkind if they change it.
* Prestige loss for marrying someone of a different tier has been doubled.
* Forming the Holy Roman Empire now requires 6 East Francia duchies to either be held by a vassal or majority-controlled -- not completely controlled.
* Forming the Holy Roman Empire early (prior to Carolingian Empire being formed) may now be done by anyone who's not a Karling and whose religion head is the Pope, and the requirements are easier to see.
* Control of Saxony is no longer required to form the Carolingian Empire, though the AI won't do it unless Saxony is out of their reach.
* Charlemagne won't start the Saxony Wars unless he can actually use the Claim CB against the Saxon king.
* Customs Houses, Toll Booths and Trade Guild Headquarters (for trade posts) should now properly apply their tax income boost via a province modifier.
* Nomads and Tribals may no longer build the trade post buildings outside of the Silk Road buildings.
* Bug fixed that prevented the building of a Trade Guild HQ
* The Chalcedonian Pope in Rome now appoints Cardinals, and is succeeded by one of them. They do not elect the Pope, however, and the succession cannot be influenced.
