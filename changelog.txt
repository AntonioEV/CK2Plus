changelog 3.06.4

* De jure kingdom assimilation changed from 50 to 100 years.
* De jure empire assimilation changed from 100 to 50 years.
* Vassal limits very reduced: base vassal limit reduced for rank: Duke from 10 to 5, King from 20 to 10, Emperor from 30 to 15, Tribal penalty from -10 to -5.
* Vassal limit reduction based on decadence increased from 25% to 50%.
* Reduced bonus to vassal limit based on Crown Authority (from 12\9\6\3\0 to 10\7\4\2\0).
* Demesne size bonus from Legalism moved to a law which changes automatically rather than a modifier.
* Jylland's Prepared Invasion of Mercia in 867AD now spawns troops based on target strength.
* Amount of forces spawned by Prepared Invasions now increased slightly, as is frequency of events occurring (still based on comparison to target's strength, however).
* Prepared Invasion CB is no longer considered a holy war.
* Moved most de jure kingdom CB's to the new region system (so they remain useable even if new de jure kingdoms appear).
* Beefed up the Shiia Revolt event slightly, and restricted it to certain geographical regions.
* AI muslims no longer go pagan (via the system of "pursuing ancient knowledge").
* Gave the Doge of Venice more gold at CM start.
* Reverted most of the balkans in the CM start to tribals.
* Revised the "introduce two friends" event chain so it makes more sense to the player what's actually happened.
* Fixed decadence gain from muslim barons.
* The HRE's creation will now have Germany return de jure control of duchies it has previously absorbed outside of its traditional borders.
* The HRE's initial creation will now rename West Francia if its renaming did not previously occur.
* Various factions now disapprove of high decadence.
* The victors in a separatist civil war also have the chance of losing control of distant/weakly-held territories after they separate.
* Fixed some counts beginning the game with a primary title not matching their capital.
* It is no longer possible to take the "Adopt the Old Ways" decision if you do not have the appropriate DLC (TOG for pagans/Zoroastrians, SOA for Jews, TOG and Charlemagne for Zunists). Doing so before would cause a CTD.
* Fixed tooltip for bastards born to matrilineally-married mothers.
* Faction anger over the granting of titles to non-landed courtiers has changed: the reaction is now delayed, in order to see what faction they join. The one they join will be pleased, while the others will still be slightly upset. The reaction now applies to all non-landed courtiers who aren't your children, even if they're of your dynasty.
* You will no longer receive the Recent Holy War cooldown if you engage in a holy war that is part of your de jure empire.
* Added a maintenance event to ensure patricians and merchant republics have the correct succession laws.
* The AI will no longer pass viceroy laws -- they are restricted to the ERE and players who wish to use them.
* The AI will not begin pretender wars for the first two years of the game, much like independence wars.
* Fixed rulers sometimes receiving Uncrowned trait at the beginning of the game.
* Fixed holy war CB so it can be used by Buddhists again.
* The Abbasids now start off with kingdom titles for Syria and Mesopotamia (to give them some actual de jure territory).
* Adventurers will now sell their estates before they leave, and will not buy new ones with the money they collect while preparing.
* Non-Muslim women may now have their claims enforced on agnatic titles, but the AI will only do so if they have a son or are formidable in some way (or their religion is feminist).
* Revamped how separatist and pretender factions are formed. Among the changes:
	- Pretenders can now be from other realms, and can potentially be called in as allies once the civil war begins.
	- Non-muslim women can now be pretenders for agnatic titles, but the AI won't support them unless they have a son or are formidable in some way.
	- Preference for women in enatic and enatic-cognatic titles now included in the logic.
	- Rulers with the Uncrowned trait are much more likely to see pretender factions form.
	- Pretender factions are a bit more likely to coalesce around a single candidate, especially in conquered titles.
	- Vassals are unlikely to join a pretender faction for a title they have a weak claim to unless it already has considerable support.
	- Pretender faction takes into account not only how much the claimant is liked, but their stats compared to the liege's.
	- Independence faction also takes into account whether the ruler is over their vassal limit.
	- Vassals are unlikely to join an independence faction if independence would place them next to a stronger ruler who can wage holy war against them.
	- Vassals are much more likely to join an independence faction the further their capital is away from their liege's.
* Vassals who have truces with their lords can no longer join Independence, Pretender, Antiking, or Religious factions. Claimants who have truces with the title holder cannot be supported by a Pretender faction.
* Regents are no longer randomly replaced by event, and there is no longer a "Become Regent" ambition. There is, however, now a "Replace Regent" plot, usuable by a ruler's courtiers and councillors when a regent is active.
* There is now also a "Usurp Titles" plot which may be used by a regent upon an adult, incapable ruler. Heirs can execute this plot relatively quickly, others less so, though in either case a lot of plot power is needed (gathered through the support of the ruler's vassals) in order to succeed.
* Faction members will now have an opinion modifier on their leader based on how close their opinions of their liege are.
* The EU4 converter now properly converts generic pagans.
* Corrected a few bad religion conversions in the EU4 converter.
* Fixed a bug that prevented some localisation from loading in the EU4 converter.
* Added missing localisation to some custom nation idea sets for the EU4 converter.
* Fixed 'the Anarchy' bookmark so the English revolt works properly.
* It is now actually possible to form the HRE if the Carolingian Empire was never formed.
