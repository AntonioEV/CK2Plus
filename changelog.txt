changelog 3.06.1

* Tribal Organization now conveys bonuses to max vassals and demesne size, similar to how Crown Authority does (but in reverse).
* Claims on de jure baronies, counties and duchies no longer require Mid-level Crown Authority.
* The AI will now only use pagan subjugation on neighboring (or very close) territories.
