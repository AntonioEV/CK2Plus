changelog 4.01.6

* The new CB's added since the HL expansion have been updated to provide success for the 'Win a War' ambition, and to properly adjust Glory faction opinions.
* Fixed major river crossings that weren't updated when the Rhine was moved back to its original vanilla placement on the map.
* The events adding and removing the Restless Sidhe modifier have been moved to the notification box, similar to general province prosperity events.
* The event for improving the combat traits of children now fires much less often if the ward already has a higher level combat trait than the guardian does.
* Fixed votes to remove a faction leader so that the faction leader votes against his removal, rather than for.
