changelog 3.06.1

* Tribal Organization now conveys bonuses to max vassals and demesne size, similar to how Crown Authority does (but in reverse).
* Claims on de jure baronies, counties and duchies no longer require Mid-level Crown Authority.
* The AI will now only use pagan subjugation on neighboring (or very close) territories.
* The AI will now be willing to press antipope claims on the Papacy even if the antipope is not of the ruler's dynasty.
* Moved the county of Sudermanland to the duchy of Uppland to solidify a king of Sweden's power a little
* Increased the holding count of Akershus, Bergenshus, and Trondelag so Norway is no longer just a tasty snack for Sweden or Denmark to munch on
* Moved Norway's capital to Trondelag
* Removed known murderer modifier since its effects were made redundant by dishonourable
