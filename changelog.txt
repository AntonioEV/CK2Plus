changelog 3.07.2

* Ambitious city mayors now have access to a "Usurp County" decision, if they rule either one of the historical merchant republic cities or are in a port city with a highly developed port (though not one in a county that is the capital of a duchy or kingdom). It's only useable on AI targets, but if successful the city will switch to become the capital of the province (if not already) and the mayor will usurp the county (leaving their former liege as the ruler of a barony instead).
* Added separate character modifier icons for each of the main factions, so you can tell which faction a vassal is in by looking at their character info.
* Fixed a result where the faction demands that one of the liege's counties be turned over to the liege -- resulting in the liege going independent -- if the liege was part of the same faction they are, but for his own liege.
* Factions now get a +50 opinion bonus when their demands are agreed to, not +25.
* The faction leader now properly gains prestige when his demand is agreed to, instead of losing it.
* Feudal kings or emperors with High or Absolute CA may now ask vassals who support them (opinion of 50+) to also support their heir once he comes to power, adding a +50 opinion bonus towards the heir for twenty years. They may refuse, but are less likely to under Absolute CA. It costs prestige to use the decision (100 for a Count, 250 for a Duke, 500 for a King).
* Shattered Realm has been slightly revamped
	- Depending on which tier of the ruling tiers you select, ie Count, Duke or King, each playable ruler will get a starting fund of around 500, 750 and 1500 respectively
	- A new CB has been added only for Shattered Realm that allows no timer county conquest on any ruler up until realm size 60. It also can't be used after 60 years of the shattered realm start.
	- The way ancient religions picks areas for said religions has been improved. This should cause a slight speed gain on first map generation of any Ancient Religions starts
