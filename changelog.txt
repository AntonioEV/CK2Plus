changelog 4.01.7

* Fixed claimant adventurers being able to send the target of their adventure a letter asking for support. Very cheeky of them, no?
* Fixed succession law factions so that, if the liege agrees to the ultimatum, the law on the title is actually changed.
* Fixed some localisation errors in events related to the succession law factions.
* Fixed immediately invalidating Carolingian Imperial Reconquest wars.
* Added a Norman event chain for Rollo to invade or seize control of the Neustrian coast, and perhaps convert or eventually be subjugated.
* Seduction is now always limited by distance to the target, whether they're both in the same realm or not.
