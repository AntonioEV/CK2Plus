changelog 3.06.2

* Become King ambition no longer selectable when a vassal (was already invalidated on selection if not independent).
* Spying via the Way of Life decision no longer reveals a lover who is the target's wife or consort.
* Added additional check so guests of feasts do not have their flags cleared before the feast is actually over.
* Court members will no longer auto-marry members of their liege's dynasty.
* Cleaned up feast events to make them mostly work from triggers instead of slowing down the system.
* Faction leaders will eventually leave their faction if they are the only member.
* You may now invite members of the target's court to join a Fabricate Treason plot (when used against a vassal).
