changelog 4.03.2

* Added a 'Women on the Council' law group under the Council laws tab. This determines whether the roles of women on the ruler's council can be expanded from the default, and at its highest level provides the prerequisite for Absolute Cognatic succession. The maximum level also establishes a realm's status as 'feminist' if passed, meaning that the normal opinion malus for a female ruler or female heir will be removed.
