changelog 3.09.3

* Titular empire and kingdom titles that are supposed to be invalid with the Charlemagne DLC active are now made inactive instead, so they cannot be seen or even searched for. If you really want to, it is okay to make the DLC inactive and those titles will re-appear during the annual maintenance (as well as the reverse -- any titles which are held will not be made inactive during maintenance).
* Instead of making the "Form New Kingdom" and "Form New Empire" decisions disappear when you hold an invalid primary title, there is now a tooltip that tells you why.
* The "barren" modifier is now only added once a character gets married/becomes a consort, to prevent the AI from magically detecting it first.
* Updated tooltips on kidnap plot event so it doesn't display that you'll be killing yourself.
* Fixed Baloch, Sogdian and Tocharian characters from not getting retinues
* Added Sahidic (Coptic) culture for Egyptians who are also Coptic/Monophysite. Egyptians characters/provinces that become Coptic/Monophysite can become Sahidic, as well as the reverse.
* Monks & Nuns will automatically become divorced when they gain the trait.
* Sons and daughters of estate holders now inherit them according to the liege's gender law.
* Added desert mothers and desert fathers for Coptics/monophysites -- they are wandering ascetic monks/nuns, and while they can become Chancellors or Lord Spirituals (and cannot lead armies), they will eventually move on to another court.
* Antipopes can no longer be targeted by the Accuse of Heresy plot.
* Coptics, Apostolics, Nestorians, and Monothelites of high Learning (8+) now have the ability to embrace either the Alexandrine or Antiochian school of theology.
* Reorganized the bookmarks so they're in chronological order again.
* Merged in parts of "High Kings and Consuls"
* Blank event description for relatives requesting to become monks/nuns is fixed.
* Made the arrow indicating blocked trade more easily distinguishable from the unblocked one.
* AI will not fight to reclaim pentarchy temples from patriarchs of the same realm and religion.
