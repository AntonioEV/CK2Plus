changelog 4.04.2

* A number of events have been added to empires based on the presence of courtiers in the top liege's court with either the Imperial Bureaucrat, Imperial Courtier, or Imperial Guard trait. One of these is likely to pop up every 5-10 years, and can lead to both good and bad effects -- from reforms being suggested to an increase in Imperial Decadence to an intrigue within the court or a claim upon the emperor's title.
* Emperors can no longer use 'Make Title Inheritable' decision upon themselves.
* The Patriarch Supreme no longer vassalizes themselves to the emperor over Rome if and when they usurp Rome, if they already have an emperor as their liege.
* Councils in an Imperial realm should give preference to counts/dukes who are inside or bordering the viceroy realm when suggesting alternate picks.
* Updated a number of events to use the new 'educator' scope and not break when the AI doesn't assign an actual guardian at age 6.
* Threat is now lowered when granting a vassal independence.
* Fixed the Kharijite Rebellion event to not invalidate the CB.
