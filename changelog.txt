changelog 4.04.4

* Cleaned up the tooltips for when the "Recent Uprising" modifiers are applied to provinces after a rebellion is defeated.
* Fixed options tooltip in child's combat training event.
* Adventurers now only recruit from provinces in the demesne of a ruler who has given them permission to do so. They must approach the top liege of the realm, and if given permission to remain must go to each vassal in that realm in turn. If they are not permitted to remain by the top liege, they cannot approach any of his vassals. Adventurers are now restricted to a maximum distance from their point of origin (so no Irish adventurers wandering their way down into Africa, or similar).
