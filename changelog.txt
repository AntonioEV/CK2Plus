changelog 3.12

* NOTE: You may experience a longer-than-normal delay as you start the game (after selecting a character), depending on your computer's processing power. This is expected.
* MAJOR: The two earliest bookmarks have merged both Catholic and Orthodox into a single Chalcedonian Christianity. The Latin Pope and the Ecumenical Patriarch rule as members of the pentarchy over their respect territories, while other kings and emperors will have autocephalous patriarchs. Events will occur that can anger the two sides and drive them further apart (such as the crowning of a Holy Roman Emperor by the Pope), and once their anger reaches a certain point the Great Schism will occur and Chalcedonians will split up into Catholic and Orthodox based on their current religion head, cultures, and top liege's choice. The Schism can be stopped if a Supreme Patriarch is anointed (meaning an actual Chalcedonian religion head, since none exists to begin), if Rome is not held by a bishop following the Latin Rites, or if Constantinople is not held by a bishop following the Greek Rites.
* Fixed province issue with Tyrnovo.
* Fixed typo in themata event.
* Restricted the Celtic Uchelwr and Laoch honorary titles by culture (as they are basically identical otherwise).
* Celtic Court Druid minor title removed, merged into Seer councillor job (localized as Court Druid for feudal/republican Celtic pagans).
* Invite Druid to Court decision removed, Invite Holy Man decision now generates druids when used by Celtic pagans.
* Celtic coming of age event can now fire for daughters as well as sons.
* Celtic characters now have a chance of gaining a level of Headhunter trait for killing opponents in battlefield duels. (This chance will be higher for more difficult opponents.)
* All holy orders now have the same one donation limit per donator's lifetime.
* Fixed bug making Kingdom of Al-Andalus uncreatable.
* Fixed opinions of sons to fathers at game start, also fixed opinions with cousins/aunts/uncles/nephews/nieces.
* AI religion heads will no longer personally lead armies during a crusade.
* There is now a decision to become the Paulician Patriarch -- unlike other Christian religion heads, this one can be held by a feudal ruler. The Patriarch in the 867 bookmark is now playable.
* Pagans now have access to all other succession types once they stop being tribal, even if their religion hasn't reformed.
* Successful rebels who were heavily-reinforced during their rebellion should no longer have large amounts of event troops sticking around forever.
<<<<<<< HEAD
* The Byzantine Emperor may freely revoke the county of Constantinople or the bishopric of Constantinople (if the holder is a different religion) from a vassal without ill effect.
* Prestige losses from marrying a lower tier are now considerably higher. The AI will also be much less willing to marry lowborn commoners.
* Forming the Carolingian Empire now requires control of Lombardy as well.
=======
 * The "courtier asks your permission to duel a rival" event should now identify the intended target.
