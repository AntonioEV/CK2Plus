changelog 3.06.6

* Fixed Hamburg to properly be a republic in 1066.
* Pechenegs no longer show as vassals of Khazaria in 867.
* Mongols will no longer default to Open Elective succession.
* AI discouraged from using holy war CB on titles that are not neighbors to continguous land.
* Slighty decreased supply limit for provinces infected with small pox and the bubonic plague. Also added a small revolt risk to provinces having a disease outbreak.
* The Theodosian Walls will no longer disappear under an AI Byzantine emperor.
* Cadet system revamped. Now a cadet is flagged as such if he has an older legitimate brother, is in a dynasty with 40+ living members, and the dynasty head is not a close relative to him or his wife or parents. He also cannot be married matrilineally or be heir to any titles. Provided none of that changes, should he eventually get a title (that does not have tanistry, seniority, or elective gavelkind succession) he may establish a cadet branch dynasty of his own (though the AI will only do this if they are ambitious, proud, or a legitimatised bastard). The player can only establish a cadet branch if they take over play of a character who has previously been flagged as a possible cadet but are otherwise eligible.
* AI made slightly less likely to marry below their rank or accept a marriage offer below their rank.
* Asking for claims from your religion head now requires 250 Piety, not 100, and also requires 100 coin. They are also a bit less likely to agree.
