changelog 3.03

* Pretender factions now issue an ultimatum to the ruler rather than instantly declaring war.
* In a pretender war, the other vassals are individually asked to support the claimant rather than it being up to the faction leaders.
* The AI will not start a pretender war until it is at least at 75% faction strength, but now does not require any additional supporters if it has enough strength on its own.
* Jewish refugees should be slightly more reliable in their appearance.
* Fixed dynasties for Sardinian and Galloway rulers.
* Switched the locations of Tregor and Porhoet.
* Navarra now begins the game as Pamplona, switching to Navarra in 1076 (there is an event to switch the name in-game).
* Players may now choose to voluntarily call faction meetings without waiting for the event to prompt it.
* Restored the proper faction icons.
* Rewards to supporters after a civil war now specifically only penalize rulers who opposed the rulers or those who consciously elected to remain neutral -- not those who did not get a chance to decide (because they were imprisoned or incapable) or who otherwise did not receive the choice event. Penalties for those who remained neutral are roughly half the penalties applied to those who opposed the ruler.
