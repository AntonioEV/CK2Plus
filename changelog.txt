changelog 4.04.0
* MAJOR: The vanilla viceroy system introduced with the Charlemagne DLC now no longer exists, and the viceroy realm laws can no longer be passed. Now, when dukes/kings in Imperial government realms (who themselves have Imperial government) either die or have their title usurped, their liege may decide whether to assent to the new holder. If they refuse, the new holder may simply elect to agree to the decision, offer a favor/bribe, or rebel. If they agree to the decision, then the emperor's council will offer up to three alternatives (which may include the new holder anyhow)...and the emperor can override this and take the title for themselves if they have enough Prestige.
* An Imperial liege may make an Imperial vassal's title inherited. This is a diplo-decision, making the vassal either Feudal or Iqta and giving them the same opinion modifier they would get if they had been granted their primary title(s) by the liege outright. The title is inherited like a normal title from that point onwards, until and unless it is ever usurped (or revoked by the liege). Note that when a ruler first passes Imperial Administration and switches to Imperial government type, ALL feudal/iqta vassals are considered to have their titles inherited in this manner.
* Note that Imperial government type no longer appears on the government map mode in the game lobby. It only appears upon game start.
* Vassals with Imperial government may never create kingdom titles and may only create titular duchies.
* There is now an Imperial Iqta government type, as well, which functions like Imperial government in all ways except it also has some of the features consistent with Iqta (holding temples, requiring piety to pass laws, etc.).
* MAJOR: map overhaul for the following regions: Africa and the Middle-East. Some areas have less provinces but their relative power should be relatively the same.
* Major history overhaul for West Africa, including a new culture; Songhai.
* Added the "Savanna" terrain type which is unique to the West African Region.
* Fixed a bug preventing Brugge from building the land-based trade route buildings.
* Bogomilists will now become theocracies once the religion is formalized, without needing to first be at war.
* The Magyar Invasion CB is no longer available to Hungarians outside of the actual bookmark invasion scenario.
* The 'Building Church of St. Bogomil' province modifier is now removed once the church is built.
* The date can no longer manually be moved forward from the 1000 AD bookmark, only from the 1066 AD bookmark (as in vanilla).
* Fixed government flavor file for Imperial governments.
* Added a setup option to start the game with "Ancient Religions" replacing default ones while leaving nations intact. This option will disappear, like other similar setup ones, after the first day of any bookmark.
* Fixed rare matrilineal marriage setting bug for titles created by event, but which only copy the owner's former primary title's laws after they are granted.
* Disabled the "Colonization of Iceland" event chain as the final colonization step proved too buggy to function as expected consistently.
* Adjusted the course of the Rhine and Danube rivers to be closer to where they should be.
* Removed the Tyrant trait -- the tyranny opinion modifier added by defying your council could not be removed, sadly, so rather than have both the trait and the opinion modifier I've elected to simply get rid of the CK2Plus tyranny system completely. The effect of all diplo-actions such as imprisonment and banishment has been restored to vanilla values.
* Ruler designed nomads will no longer cause the nomadic realm to split because clans are unhappy about the new dynasty ruling.
* Increased maximum population for nomads received from empty holdings (and thus overall population growth).
* Rollo now always has to fight for Normandy, rather than gaining the provinces by event if their holders are AI.
* Added sicilians into province and character histories, thanks to user daniloy.
* Close relatives of Dukes and Kings in empires (whether they have Imperial government or not) have a chance of asking to go to serve in the emperor's court for up to ten years if they have no pressing job back home. Should the emperor give them a councillor or commander position -- or a title -- they'll remain away until and unless they inherit. Otherwise they'll return after a time with either good effects (higher education trait, increased stat, a lifestyle trait, etc.) or bad (a bastard child, they become drunkard, they become depressed, etc.).
* All emperors with Imperial Government now have the option of spending 100 Prestige and up to 5 Imperial Decadence (less if ID is already higher) to corrupt a corruptible council member and give them a +50 opinion bonus for five years. This can only be done once per year, and has the side-effect of potentially giving the councillor some additional negative traits.
* 'Claim the Imperial Throne' decision now available to all vassals of duke or higher tier in Imperial Government realms. It has been simplified to cost 1000 Prestige.
* Added an 'Overthrow the Empire' plot useable in Imperial Government realms by member's of the emperor's council who have a claim on his primary title. This allows them to plan a coup in the imperial palace, one which involves all plotters as active participants (provided they are actually present in the capital) and can end with injury, death, or capture for any of the participants (including the ruler, so long as they are not away from the capital at the time).
* EU4 Converter updated for version 1.15 of EU4 and 4.04.X of CK2+. Please note that development for the CK2+ to EU4 converter will be discontinued with the release of 1.16 of EU4.
* Re-enabled 'Weaken Fellow Vassal' plot, now that viceroys no longer exist to screw it up.
