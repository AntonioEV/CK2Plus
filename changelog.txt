changelog 3.06.4

* Base vassal limit reduced for rank: Duke from 10 to 5, King from 20 to 10, Emperor from 30 to 15, Tribal penalty from -10 to -5.
* Vassal limit reduction based on decadence increased from 25% to 50%.
* Reduced bonus to vassal limit based on Crown Authority (from 12\9\6\3\0 to 10\7\4\2\0).
* Jylland's Prepared Invasion of Mercia in 867AD now spawns troops based on target strength.
* Amount of forces spawned by Prepared Invasions now increased slightly, as is frequency of events occurring (still based on comparison to target's strength, however).
* Prepared Invasion CB is no longer considered a holy war.
* Moved most de jure kingdom CB's to the new region system (so they remain useable even if new de jure kingdoms appear).
* Beefed up the Shiia Revolt event slightly, and restricted it to certain geographical regions.
* AI muslims no longer go pagan (via the system of "pursuing ancient knowledge").
* Gave the Doge of Venice more gold at CM start.
* Reverted most of the balkans in the CM start to tribals.
* Revised the "introduce two friends" event chain so it makes more sense to the player what's actually happened.
* Fixed decadence gain from muslim barons.
* The HRE's creation will now have Germany return de jure control of duchies it has previously absorbed outside of its traditional borders.
* The HRE's initial creation will now rename West Francia if its renaming did not previously occur.
* Various factions now disapprove of high decadence.
* The victors in a separatist civil war also have the chance of losing control of distant/weakly-held territories after they separate.
* Fixed some counts beginning the game with a primary title not matching their capital.
* Faction anger over granting landed titles to non-faction members now specified in the opinion text.
* Added note of the above to the tooltip on factions.
* You will no longer receive the Recent Holy War cooldown if you engage in a holy war that is part of your de jure empire.
* Added a maintenance event to ensure patricians and merchant republics have the correct succession laws.
* The AI will no longer pass viceroy laws -- they are restricted to the ERE and players who wish to use them.
* The AI will not begin pretender wars for the first two years of the game, much like independence wars.
* Fixed rulers sometimes receiving Uncrowned trait at the beginning of the game.
* Fixed holy war CB so it can be used by Buddhists again.
* Demesne size bonus from Legalism moved to a law which changes automatically rather than a modifier.
* Non-Muslim women may now have their claims enforced on agnatic titles, but the AI will only do so if they have a son or are formidable in some way (or their religion is feminist).
* Revamped how separatist and pretender factions are formed. Among the changes:
	- Pretenders can now be from other realms, and can potentially be called in as allies once the civil war begins.
	- Non-muslim women can now be pretenders for agnatic titles, but the AI won't support them unless they have a son or are formidable in some way.
	- Preference for women in enatic and enatic-cognatic titles now included in the logic.
	- Rulers with the Uncrowned trait are much more likely to see pretender factions form.
	- Pretender factions are a bit more likely to coalesce around a single candidate, especially in conquered titles.
	- Vassals are unlikely to join a pretender faction for a title they have a weak claim to unless it already has considerable support.
	- Pretender faction takes into account not only how much the claimant is liked, but their stats compared to the liege's.
	- Independence faction also takes into account whether the ruler is over their vassal limit.
	- Vassals are unlikely to join an independence faction if independence would place them next to a stronger ruler who can wage holy war against them.
	- Vassals are much more likely to join an independence faction the further their capital is away from their liege's.
