changelog 4.04.1
* Fixed the 'Create Provincia' decisions to account for the map changes.
* Fixed the faction demand for a liege's title so that it works again.
* Removed starting alliance between Khazars/Cumans in the OG bookmark, as it would occasionally make everyone allied with everyone.
* The Byzantine minor title Despot has been made a councillor.
* Added a historical war between the Almoravids and Ghana in 1066
* Made formation of regular titular kingdoms by the AI less common.
* Increased population-per-empty province limit for nomads.
* Added event to have provinces along the trade routes in West Africa possibly convert to Cairo's religion between 900 and 1050 if they are unreformed Pagan.
* Added event to have provinces along the Amber Road in Eastern Europe possibly convert to Byzantium's or Poland's religion between 1000 and 1150 if they are unreformed Pagan.
* Changed the localisation for nomadic Magyars.
* AI Altaic tribal rulers who have a few provinces and high Martial and enough prestige may now switch to Nomadic government.
* Courtiers in the capital of an empire now have a chance of gaining one of three traits over time: Imperial Bureaucrat, Imperial Courtier, or Imperial Guard. These will give them a bonus to their traits, and also prompt them to seek employment as councillors elsewhere in the empire should the Imperial court begin to get full.
* Adjusted the flow of the West African trade network
* Fixed the 'Sidhe Offerings' event so it only has one possible outcome that fires.
* Fixed (hopefully) the occasional liberation revolt result where province capital holdings are changed.
* A liege with Imperial Government revoking a feudal title now properly reverts that title to remain Imperial even when granted to a new vassal.
* Tribal AI will now sometimes use tributary CB against targets which they cannot subjugate.
* Rollo will no longer use tribal/norse CB's.
* The old pagan mystic who shows up at your court now appears with higher Health, so there's less chance of them dying immediately.
* The "Go Pagan" conversion event will now also convert all close relative and same-dynasty courtiers.
* Unreformed pagans may now use the 'Attempt Religious Conversion' decision, though they must spend Prestige to do so. The AI will not do so unless it is Zealous.
* Heritage focus can now be taken for a child before the age of 6.
* The 'Ask Permission for Heritage Focus' diplo-decision can no longer be used on a child if you're their actual liege.
* Added a 'Scourge Province' decision (usable on count title) which allows a non-reformed pagan to scourge an owned province of their culture but a different religion, giving them a chance at converting the province at the expense of tyranny and an unrest modifier for five years.
* Added more variability to the strength of nationalist rebellions.
* The 'Make Title Inheritable' decision is now only useable on vassals which have a regular succession law (ie. for non-primary type titles).
