changelog 4.01.2

* Byzantine Subjugation CB now requires a CA of Medium or higher. It also now targets a de jure duchy, and if the holder of the duchy (or counties within the duchy, if the duchy has no holder) has no counties outside of the needed regions they will be vassalized. If they do hold counties outside the region, or are Emperor-tier, the duchy will be usurped instead.
* Removed the change to the Rhine, moving it back to its original vanilla location (to free up mod space).
* Fixed Afghan, Baloch, and Sogdian retinues.
* Fixed up the event chains for Seljuk, Timur, and Sabuktigin to appear. Seljuk in particular is likely to first appear as a nomad adventurer, though he will quickly settle if he takes feudal territory.
* Fixed Enforce Chalcedon and Enforce Ephesus decisions so they can actually be used by Nestorians and Miaphysites, respectively.
* Made Edward the Confessor once more "Eadward".
