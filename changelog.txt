changelog 4.01.4

* MAJOR: All former tax and levy laws are now changed to the demesne law system used by EMF -- namely an Obligations law for each holding type, and a "slider" that allows you to customize whether you'd like to focus on levies or taxes (or strike a balance between the two).
* Venice now playable in all bookmarks.
* Fixed Restore Themata System decision to properly increase Crown Authority by only one level.
* Patricians without county holdings now have more consistent access to the employment decisions.
* The AI will now not create a new dynasty when it is heir or pretender to a title held by a member of their current dynasty.
* Banishing a decadent dynasty member when there are no other rulers of your religion will now not result in them remaining in your realm.
* Fixed the decadence tooltip to not state that imprisoning a decadent dynasty will mean they don't count towards your decadence trait.
* Merchant Republics can no longer seize patrician family palaces through their CB.
* The decision to lay a claim on the Byzantine Empire should now be more visible to players, and now solely requires that the emperor not have the Strong Basileus trait.
* The Bogomilist religion head is now called an Elder, and is elected by a Council of Advisors filled by five Stroinik/Stroinitsa selected from those with the Perfectum trait.
* The Subjugation CB can now be used by non-tribal & non-nomadic rulers against de jure vassals who are either independent or part of the same realm, and who are either both of the same culture group and religion or who have previously become independent through rebellion or after a different rebellion has resulted in them breaking free (these now apply the 'Broke Vassal Contract' opinion modifier, inherited by heirs for the next 50 years, instead of providing claims to the former liege). It does not require that the Crown Authority of king and empire titles be first raised to Medium or above, as de jure claim wars do. If the target was one who became independent, the CB will not only re-vassalize them but also imprison them (and the 'Broke Vassal Contract' opinion will allow revocation/execution).
* When a minor clan rises in a nomad realm, the nomadic ruler will have the opportunity to simply give them the county and let them become a major clan in the realm rather than fight them.
* Changed name of Finnish pagan high priest/priestess.
* Revamped events for appearance of Genghis Khan -- Genghis will now definitely expand rapidly and not simply sit there with his troops.
