changelog 3.07.4

* The regular 'Demand Religious Conversion' diplo action has been removed. It has been replaced with 'Attempt Religious Conversion' -- usable under in the same circumstances (though it costs 50 Piety to attempt to convert a vassal, instead of simply 10 for a courtier), you will need to decide your approach (diplomacy, religious debate, or threat of imprisonment if you have at least Medium CA/Tribal Organization) and then the target will respond either with refusal, conversion, or sympathy (though sympathy cannot be gained with threats). Each approach has a different chance of working, depending on the target and circumstances, though only diplomacy/debate can get a target to honestly convert (otherwise they will likely remain sympathetic to their old religion, and/or become Cynical). Be careful debating someone with higher Learning than you, or you may end up becoming sympathetic to THEIR religion, instead!
* Religion heads now always pay 100 Piety for holy wars (never 250), and can go into Piety "debt" if they so desire.
* Fixed stem duchy creation when HRE is created without East Francia having existed first.
* Fixed some duplicate retinues
* Fixed Mongol Empire split event
* "Protected Inheritance" (titles cannot succeed to outside the realm) moved from High to Medium Crown Authority.
* "King's Peace" moved from Medium to High Crown Authority.
* "Title Revocation" moved from Autonomous Vassals to Limited Crown Authority.
* Finally fixed the issue where Liberation Revolt leaders would sometimes end up with a city or temple capital.
