* Changed Viking Prepared Invasion CB to require 12-50 holdings in the target kingdom (instead of 10-40)
* Event for Jylland's Prepared Invasion of Mercia now checks to ensure Mercia (or Wessex) is a valid invasion target before firing
* Changed the requirements for forming new kingdoms/empires (via the Charlemagne decision): they are more in line with forming regular titles, requiring a minimum of three lower-tier titles, but also have a hefty prestige cost.
* Reduced frequency of AI both choosing the Seduction focus as well as reduced frequency/chance of them selecting someone to seduce.
* Someone can only be seduced if they are in the same realm or relatively close to the seducer.
* Someone of the same sex, but who is not a homosexual, can be seduced by a homosexual. Their chances of success are much reduced, however, and the target cannot be made a lover.
* Overall chances of succeeding at seduction are somewhat reduced. After two rebuffs (three if you're a seducer/seductress) you cannot continue the attempt any longer.
* There is a cooldown period of one year between seductions before it can be attempted again.
