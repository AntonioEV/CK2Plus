changelog 3.05.5

* Incapable and infirm characters should no longer be able to compete in the tournament.
* Byzantine emperor in the CM bookmark should now start with the proper coronated trait and flags, so setup will work properly.
* Byzantium no longer gets the "Sicily Regained" event in the CM bookmark start.
* Fixed "Little Queen of Sheba" bookmark.
* Seduction chance of success now takes into account the target's feelings for their current spouse/lover (if any) rather than just their opinion of the seducer.
* A successfully seduced target who is not lustful, a hedonist, or deceitful will break up with their previous lover.
* Fixed the "Break Up" decision to work properly.
* Successful "overthrow ruler" rebellion now has proper results if overthrown ruler is a child.
* Expelling the jews now removes "sympathy judaism" trait. The AI will not use the decision if they have the trait.
* Welcoming the jews back into your lands now may add the "sympathy judaism" trait. It will remove the zealous trait, if you have it.
* Pagan Subjugation CB now properly fulfills the Win a War ambition.
* Viceroys will attempt to pass on their wealth to a relative rather than onto their liege.
* Mending the Schism is now far more likely to convert enough provinces so that it isn't automatically reversed a month later.
* Abdication and Disinheritance are now easier for the player to take, with restrictions mostly moved to AI use.
* Fixed too-long Chronicle entries which could cause a save game to break.
