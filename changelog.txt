changelog 3.031

* Steam Workshop upload
* Non-feudal kingdoms can now change CA again
* Added some random dynasties for the proto-Russian and Arberian cultures
* Upon reforming the Roman Empire, the emperor can change to Roman culture after ruling for 5 years
* Children no longer engage in the Hellenic cults
* The Byzantine Empire must deal with 'imperial decadence', which reduces levies, taxes, and army morale...and which gets worse as the years pass. Each new emperor that takes the throne increases the decadence value, and when they're coronated the Ecumenical Patriarch decides whether they're worthy of being a 'strong basileus' or not. If they are, the decadence gets reduced, and the emperor can increase CA past low. If not, the emperor can gain the 'strong basileus' trait and also reduce their overall decadence by winning wars and gaining prestige. If the empire loses wars, their decadence will occur more rapidly.
* Arabic cultures should now have the proper settlement gfx
* Coronations now apply to titular kings/emperors as well
* Pressing claims on behalf of vassals for independent, non-de jure titles now does not result in them leaving the realm if the title is the same tier as the one they already have--it must be higher
* Added ambition for adult bastards to become legitimized--this will spawn an event, which replaces the vanilla event for being asked to legitimize a bastard. Upon the event, the bastard can be refused, can be bought off by granting them a manor (if they aren't a ruler and don't already have one), or can be legitimized.
* Bastards who would have inherited had they been legitimate will receive an event upon their younger sibling inheriting, and have the option to make a claim on the title. Vassals who like the bastard more than you may support him (an opinion bonus). If the bastard is in your court, you have the option to imprison them.
* Unknown bastards (bastard children to married mothers whose husbands thought the child was theirs) have a chance of suspecting the truth come adulthood, and may decide to approach their real father and demand to know the truth. Their real father can deny it or tell them, which will turn them into a regular bastard. They may ask to be legitimized at that time, as well.
* The Pope will single out empires who pass free investiture before it will single out kingdoms.
* Revised the way estates are dealt with upon death. One rank of estates is handed out to each legitimate son, in order of age--as cash if they are already rulers or have the maximum estates. If there are any ranks of estates remaining afterwards, they are converted into cash in order to be given to the heir.
* The Pagan/Muslim Count Conquest CB no longer adds the 5-year timer unless the user isn't victorious (either loss or white peace will add the timer).
* Pagan Subjugation CB re-added, though it can only be used once per ruler's lifetime (the Become King ambition does not ignore this).
* The Magyar invasion of Hungary in the 867 bookmark now properly awards prestige and wealth to the Magyar ruler upon victory. Once the Magyar ruler has distributed enough titles, many (but not all) of the event troops will vanish--"settling down" into their new homes and turning the provinces Hungarian. This will also remove the "Recently Conquered" modifier on those holdings and refill their levies. They do not get new event troops.
* The decisions to automate the handing out of baronies and counties has been revised and made more user-friendly. It now begins with a decision that explains the system. Your marshal can be moved to provinces which can be flagged to keep, and you can elect to flag only the capital holding or all holdings in the province. The decision to distribute holdings will now tell you which holdings you will be keeping. The automation now works for all gender laws, and religions assign priests of the appropriate gender and education. There is also a decision to clear the other automation decisions from your list (you can re-access it later).
