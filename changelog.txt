changelog 3.06.1

* The AI will now only use pagan subjugation on neighboring (or very close) territories.
* The AI will now be willing to press antipope claims on the Papacy even if the antipope is not of the ruler's dynasty.
* Moved the county of Sudermanland to the duchy of Uppland to solidify a king of Sweden's power a little
* Increased the holding count of Akershus, Bergenshus, and Trondelag so Norway is no longer just a tasty snack for Sweden or Denmark to munch on
* Moved Norway's capital to Trondelag
* Being caught murdering someone will now give an extra level of Dishonourable (for a total of 2, which wear off at the usual speed) instead of vanilla's permanent "Known Murderer" modifier.
* Factions in the HRE are more disapproving of Crown Authority, and more likely to demand it be reduced.
* The descriptions of Autonomous Vassals and Low Crown Authority now contain a note that Kingdom and Empire de jure claims cannot be made.
* Faction vote results will now display the vote of the player.
* Ruler name has been added to the faction mood tooltips, so they make sense (particularly in the CB code).
* The 'support our liege' faction result now states that prestige is being transferred to the liege, so it's not confusing.
* Revolts that stem from failed imprisonment will no longer be rendered invalid.
