changelog 4.03.1

* Female rulers made with the Ruler Designer will now get the default Agnatic-Cognatic succession law, as intended.
* Rulers made with the Ruler Designer will now not start off having courtiers/vassals with negative opinions caused by being fired from the council.
* Revolting against the liege via the regular factions (Court, Prosperity, Glory, Tradition) will now disable any non-aggression pact held with them.
* Fixed duchy adventurers from sometimes ending up with an improper government type after usurping the titles.
* The Pagan County Conquest CB now allows the ruler to usurp baronies in the target county held by rulers who are neither his culture nor religion, and the tooltip will properly display that.
* Fixed Kharijite Rebellion event so the revolt doesn't invalidate.
* Fixed liberation revolts so existing rulers may now actually join the rebel leader if he is landless.
* 'Invite Priest to Court' decision now starts the new character off as a monk, nun, perfecti, desert father, or desert mother (depending on the religion) and thus eligible to be a Lord Spiritual. It also has a 50% chance of creating a woman, if the religion allows female temple holders.
