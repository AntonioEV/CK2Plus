* The Byzantine Empire must deal with 'imperial decadence', which reduces levies, taxes, and army morale...and which gets worse as the years pass. Each new emperor that takes the throne increases the decadence value, and when they're coronated the Ecumenical Patriarch decides whether they're worthy of being a 'strong basileus' or not. If they are, the decadence gets reduced, and the emperor can increase CA past low. If not, the emperor can gain the 'strong basileus' trait and also reduce their overall decadence by winning wars and gaining prestige. If the empire loses wars, their decadence will occur more rapidly.
