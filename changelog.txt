changelog 4.03.2

* Added a 'Women on the Council' law group under the Council laws tab. This determines whether the roles of women on the ruler's council can be expanded from the default, and at its highest level provides the prerequisite for Absolute Cognatic succession. The maximum level also establishes a realm's status as 'feminist' if passed, meaning that the normal opinion malus for a female ruler or female heir will be removed.
* Fixed matrilineal marriages from becoming disallowed when a new primary title is created.
* Female nomads created by the Ruler Designer now also get their primary title changed to Agnatic-Cognatic succession (after one day).
* Rulers without a crown law title (such as independent dukes) may now pass the Revoke Title laws without worrying about Crown Authority.
* Fabricated claims which were accidentally made super-cheap as of two versions ago have now been restored to their pricier, minimum costs.
