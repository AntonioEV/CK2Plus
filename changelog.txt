changelog 3.09.3

* Titular empire and kingdom titles that are supposed to be invalid with the Charlemagne DLC active are now made inactive instead, so they cannot be seen or even searched for. If you really want to, it is okay to make the DLC inactive and those titles will re-appear during the annual maintenance (as well as the reverse -- any titles which are held will not be made inactive during maintenance).
* Instead of making the "Form New Kingdom" and "Form New Empire" decisions disappear when you hold an invalid primary title, there is now a tooltip that tells you why.
