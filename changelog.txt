changelog 3.06.3

* Fixed spying event chain when you choose to immediately reveal your target's affair.
* Revamped adventurer code so they choose destinations a bit more realistically.
* Reduced AI use of castration/blinding.
* The AI will fight for claims of spouses and occasionally friends/lovers even if that doesn't mean they'll become vassals afterwards.
* Adjusted the balance in scandinavia in the 769 start (specifically Sjaelland)
* Changed Slesvig's localization to Jylland since that's the proper name for the area the duchy encompasses.
* Changed the Kingdom of Sweden's Norse name to Vilkinaland to differentiate from the duchy of uppland (also because it's historically accurate)
* War during the planning stages of a feast will now properly cancel the feast.
* Elective Gavelkind is now open to non tribals.
* Removal of an antipope via the Antiking CB or the Depose Antipope CB now works normally.
* Tournaments and furusiyya cleaned up to work via triggers, similarly to feasts.
* Tournament 1st/2nd/3rd place events now influenced by personal combat rating as well as martial rating.
* Kemetic, Jewish and Zoroastrian "restore religious head" decisions will now promote the holder of a holy site within the restorer's realm (if available - otherwise another random priest will be promoted), to ensure that the religious head has land and can declare Great Holy Wars if otherwise available.
