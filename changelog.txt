changelog 4.04.2

* A number of events have been added to empires based on the presence of courtiers in the top liege's court with either the Imperial Bureaucrat, Imperial Courtier, or Imperial Guard trait. One of these is likely to pop up every 5-10 years, and can lead to both good and bad effects -- from reforms being suggested to an increase in Imperial Decadence to an intrigue within the court or a claim upon the emperor's title.
* Emperors can no longer use 'Make Title Inheritable' decision upon themselves.
* The Patriarch Supreme no longer vassalizes themselves to the emperor over Rome if and when they usurp Rome, if they already have an emperor as their liege.
* Councils in an Imperial realm should give preference to counts/dukes who are inside or bordering the viceroy realm when suggesting alternate picks.
* Updated a number of events to use the new 'educator' scope and not break when the AI doesn't assign an actual guardian at age 6.
* Threat is now lowered when granting a vassal independence.
* Fixed the Kharijite Rebellion event to not invalidate the CB.
* Fixed tournament winners sometimes being calculated incorrectly and not properly favoring the highest Martial attendees.
* Relinquishing a viceroy title for a favor also increases Imperial Decadence, the same as accepting a bribe.
* Fixed the "Restored Roman Borders" event to actually look for more than central Anatolia provinces.
* Fixed Imperial Decadence so it actually reduces the liege's levy totals and the levies from their vassals.
* Dealing with a province where a religious or nationalist rebellion began will now also stop similar rebellions in realm provinces of the same religion/culture for up to 3 years, depending on the harshness of the example.
* The 'Claim Caliphate' decision is now only available to members of the caliph's realm.
* Fixed a bug which made the Ecumenical Patriarch *more* likely to refuse your coronation if he didn't hate you.
* An Ecumenical Patriarch who refuses to coronate the Byzantine emperor may now be asked again in three years, rather than ten.
* Rebels and adventurers no longer get free money until *after* they achieve victory.
* Fixed a bug where landless rebels/adventurers could hire mercenaries after their forces were destroyed, putting those mercenaries in limbo and thus eventually causing a crash.
