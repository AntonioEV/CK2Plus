changelog 4.01.3

* MAJOR: Nomad rulers with 25+ realm provinces and 4+ demesne provinces who die with at least two adult, capable sons will now split the clan between them (amongst up to four sons, depending on the realm size). The sons not inheriting the main title may choose to split off and become independant, and neighboring clans may choose to join them. To reduce border gore, provinces which are not connected by land to either the realm capital or the capital of a nomadic vassal will be usurped by one of the sons who has a neighboring province.
* MAJOR: Added new factions for Seniority, Primogeniture, Gavelkind, and Feudal Elective succession. The factions work much the same as in vanilla, except -- if the liege refuses the ultimatum -- the rebellion itself works the same as the general faction rebellions, with individual vassals being called to join in. The factions themselves will only appear under certain conditions: if the culture is appropriate for the succession type, if the title previously had that succession law, or if the heir under that law is particularly ambitious and capable.
* Empires now require only 2 King titles to form, instead of 3.
* Kingdoms now require only 2 Duchy titles to form, instead of 3.
* To form an empire now requires the holder to have either 150 realm holdings OR 50 realm provinces. Maintaining the empire requires either 100 realm holdings OR 35 realm provinces.
* Nomad realms may now have up to 12 clans, and the ideal size for each clan has been reduced slightly.
* Nomad rebellions won't be started by the AI for the first two years of the game, like the other rebellions.
* Forts are now free, but take 60 days to build (instead of 20) and have a much smaller garrison.
* Empty provinces now require 50 soldiers to occupy (instead of 100).
* If a new nomadic khagan is of a different dynasty than the last one, there is a chance that their clans will decide to split off on their own (the chance is based on their clan opinion of you, as well as your relative power to each other, in addition to their personal traits). If they split off, you will get a strong but not inheritable claim on all their counties.
* Tributaries are automatically inherited if a ruler abdicates or his title is passed off to another after a succession crisis.
* Extra daughters for early bookmarks now appear at the start again (instead of after one day) and still have randomized traits.
* The Shattered Realm decision will no longer make bunch of clone characters. After all decisions have been made the game must be run at speed 1 for exactly one day, then paused to allow the game to catch up on generating the characters.
* Tweaked the initial distribution of duel engine combat traits to include martially-educated courtiers as well as landed rulers.
* Battlefield duels should now more consistently impact the morale balance of the battle.
* Fixed the Settle Province job action for nomadic stewards.
* Winter supply reductions have been halved, to match the halving of the base supply limit.
* Players will no longer be included in the "extra daughters for early bookmarks" function.
* The "Saint" and "Martyr" nicknames will no longer be gained except on death, through the sainthood system.
* The "Recent Uprising" province modifier added by Peasant, Decadence, and Minor Clan revolts now lasts 10 years instead of 5.
* Religious, Heretic, and Liberation revolts now give you the option of dealing with the province where they originated, once the war is over. You can "teach them a lesson", giving you +1 tyranny and adding a harsh penalty to taxea and levies for five years but extending the "Recent Uprising" modifier to ten years and giving a 25% chance of converting religion/culture (depending on the uprising type), "force them to convert" which gives you +2 tyranny and harsher penalties, but the "Recent Uprising" modifier lasts twenty years and there is a 50% chance of conversion, or you can opt to find a more peaceful solution (ie. do nothing).
* Trade network roads now increase movement speed of armies dependant on rank
* Patricians without county holdings should now be able to join factions.
* Fixed the province of Oland.
* For the EU4 Converter, fixed a bug that prevented the loading of National Idea localization
* Fixed a number of instances, such as with the schisms, where the effects would ignore characters/provinces in rebelling realms.
* Fixed Bogomilist rulers bouncing back and forth between different religion organization laws, losing Piety each time.
* Fixed mixed up Shekinah choices localisation.
* Pretender factions now cannot support a claimant of a different realm unless the claimant is not a ruler or the claimed title's holder is independent.
* The ruler of Poland-Lithuania is now called 'King' even though it remains an Empire-tier title.
* The Shiite Caliphate revolt has been made more likely to happen, and if the Imamah should vanish then the Fatimid dynasty head can step forward and assume the title.
* Incorporated new Coptic dynasty names helpfully supplied by user Polskers.
* The AI will no longer use some CB's on non-neighboring targets unless they have at least the first level of naval tech available.
* The "rule in peace for 10 years" ambition now works for vassals, as well.
* Viking adventurers (including raiding adventurers) will no longer appear until the Viking Age actually begins.
* Trade Network values have been tweaked. The base wealth of all trade networks, except for the African Trade and Silk Road, has been massively reduced. In exchange the contribution from buildings in trade posts in those networks has been greatly increased, especially from trade guilds.
* Vassal limit for emperors raised slightly (multiplier raised from 15 to 20).
* Asking for excommunication cost raised (now costs 100 Wealth and 250 Piety).
* The barony of Wallingford has been moved from Oxford to Berkshire.
* Imprisoning an adventurer will now actually end their adventure (so banishing them doesn't mean they'll simply continue their attempt).
* Adventurers now will never attempt a second adventure in their lifetime, should they fail the first.
* Fixed an issue where killing a kidnap victim sometimes didn't result in them actually dying.
* Fixed name issue with Michael I of Byzantium.
* Cleaned up some duplicate character history entries for rulers in Armenia Minor and Antioch.
* Fixed two rulers in the New Millenium bookmark who were beginning as theocracies but shouldn't have been.
* Non-feudal AI vassals who gain a kingdom as a result of a crusade will never keep the kingdom for themselves.
