changelog 3.07.2

* Ambitious city mayors now have access to a "Usurp County" decision, if they rule either one of the historical merchant republic cities or are in a port city with a highly developed port (though not one in a county that is the capital of a duchy or kingdom). It's only useable on AI targets, but if successful the city will switch to become the capital of the province (if not already) and the mayor will usurp the county (leaving their former liege as the ruler of a barony instead).
* Added separate character modifier icons for each of the main factions, so you can tell which faction a vassal is in by looking at their character info.
* Fixed a result where the faction demands that one of the liege's counties be turned over to the liege -- resulting in the liege going independent -- if the liege was part of the same faction they are, but for his own liege.
* Factions now get a +50 opinion bonus when their demands are agreed to, not +25.
* The faction leader now properly gains prestige when his demand is agreed to, instead of losing it.
