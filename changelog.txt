changelog 3.07

* Liberation revolts, provided they are under an existing ruler, will now unite under that ruler the same as faction revolts.
* Fixed several pagan holy orders which were not updating when the religion was reformed (NOTE: this is not retroactive on old saves).
* The Magyars now have a decision to simulate the 867 bookmark's invasion of Carpathia, for a CM bookmark start. It's permitted after 800 if they are between 6-12 realm size and neighbor a realm that owns Pest, though the AI won't take it until much later.
* Conversion of pagans through your lord spiritual made a bit easier.
* Changed how courtiers (and friends) convert others to their religion -- now the first step is to give the target a sympathy trait, and then if they already have the trait they can convert with a later event. Rulers are also made much less likely to convert to different religion groups unless they are in a province of that religion.
* Expanded religions that can intermarry: African pagans and pagans based in the east can nor intermarry with Muslims and Zoroastrians. Pagans based in the west can intermarry with Christians.
* All reformed pagans no longer care about tribal organization.
* Fraticelli lords are now able to hold temples without penalty.
* Roman Empire now has the proper requirements when being created via regular title creation and fires the proper event when created this way
* Germanic Holy Order given Donation and Expulsion decisions
* Missing icons added for the Braedralag donation and Expulsion decisions
* The AI will now destroy custom-created titular titles when and if it gets a non-titular title of equal tier.
* Vanilla event chain where wife tries to poison your heir fixed up -- should also no longer end with the wife imprisoning you instead of the reverse.
* Provinces gained through war will gain a "chaos" modifier that lowers the revolt chance for two years.
* "Holy Warrior" trait added as a crusader-type trait for non-christians/muslims on a Great Holy War.
* Imperial Reconquest CB for the Roman Empire now works for Hellenic rulers as well, but is always treated as a holy war when used against targets of a different religion.
* The duchies for Aland and Isle of Man may now only be formed by someone who is lower than Duke tier and who owns at least three counties -- it is not enough to just own the one province any longer.
* Removed the timer that prevents a player from using the Seduce diplo decision more than once a year -- use it as often as you dare.
* Moved the Suggest Fatwa, Castrate, Blind and Zun Judgement decisions to the diplo menu.
* The Suggest Fatwa may now only be used against the head of a dynasty.
