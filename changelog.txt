changelog 3.05.6

* Setup changed at the Charlemagne start:
	- West Francia is named Neustria
	- Middle Francia is named Austrasia, and extends well into central Germany
	- Saxony and Bavaria are both de jure kingdoms
	- East Francia does not exist
* The formation of the Carolingian Empire has changed: the ruler must have control of Neustria and Austrasia and either they must control Bavaria and Saxony or control those duchies and their kingdom titles do not exist. Once the Carolingian Empire has formed, West Francia and Middle Francia will be renamed and de jure East Francia will be formed.
* There is no need to pay to form the Carolingian Empire if the ruler is already the Frankish emperor.
* Forming the Carolingian Empire makes the ruler Exalted if they are not already.
* Any Karling king or emperor has a Manifest Destiny CB to take non-Karling lands in Neustria, Austrasia, Saxony or Bavaria which are ruled by someone of the same religion. If they become Exalted, this extends to Frisia, Italy, Burgundy, and Aquitaine. The CB no longer exists after the HRE is formed.
* Made the AI becoming a heretic through the Theology focus much less common.
