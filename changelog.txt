changelog 3.07.3

* The AI will never send anyone into hiding if the plot is known about and has less than 50% plot power.
* AI characters with possessed trait no longer pick irrational targets to murder -- they only are far more likely to make the attempt. Lunatics still pick irrational targets.
* Number of opinion modifiers which cause the "is_foe" trigger expanded, and made applicable for the Take Revenge plot.
