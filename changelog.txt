changelog 3.09

* Expanded the Trade Network
	- Amber Road Trade Network added. This land route extends from Novgorod to Venice
	- Mediterranean Trade Network added. This mostly sea based trade network expands out of Constantinople, Antioch and Alexandria and reaches as far as the Straits of Gibraltar
	- Baltic Road Trade Network added. This mostly sea based trade network expands out of Constantinople and covers much of the Baltics
* Bogomilism has been updated as per the Heretic Pride mod. Bogomilists now:
	- have an event for Bogomil's appearance in Bulgaria, if Tyrnovo has become Orthodox
	- feudal rulers may have temple holdings as well as castles
	- may use the Consolamentum decision to become Perfecti
	- may use the adoption decision, as the Cathar do
	- may gain the Icon-Breaker trait by sieging Christian temples
	- occasionally spawn missionaries in neighboring non-Bogomilist courts
	- are anti-church and anti-feudal at the outset, but may reform their faith through a series of laws and decisions to the point of allowing temple holders to once again be bishops and to have a religion head
	- may not have Perfecti in government positions until the religion has been sufficiently reformed
	- may build the Church of St. Bogomil once the religion has been sufficiently reformed
