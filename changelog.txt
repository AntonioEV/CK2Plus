changelog 3.08

* Characters created via the Ruler Designer should now properly receive the startup events (the Crowned trait, Byzantine initialization event, etc.)
* Coronations are now properly cancelled when a war occurs.
* Fixed the Paulician use of the Holy War CB on same-religion group targets.
* Added some logic for where heresies appear -- they are more likely to show up in their historical areas (such as Catharism in southern France), and occasionally instead of a "heresy" the character/province may instead switch to another religion in the same religion group (such as a Sunni province embracing Shiia), though only where it's logical to do so. On the rare occasion, a potential heretic may embrace another religion group entirely, though again only where it's logical for that to occur (a Muslim may decide to become Manichaean, for instance, but only in Persia or Central Asia).
* Manichaeism is no longer a Zoroastrian heresy, but rather a religion of its own within the same religion group. Zurvanism has been added as a Zoroastrian heresy, and Mandaean has been added as a Manichaean heresy.
* Updated the Manichaean faith, as per the Heretic Pride mod. Manichaeans now:
	 - Have a religious head, which exists in the Charlemagne and Old Gods bookmarks, and can be restored afterwards.
	 - Have their own holy feast decision, the Bema Feast.
	 - Receive a defensive bonus for their armies, on their own territory.
	 - May dedicate themselves to a Shekhinah upon adulthood.
	 - May found a new holy order, the Army of Light.
