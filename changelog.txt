changelog 4.02.1

* Restored the War of Two Eriks.
* Made councillors vote according to their faction's interests, provided their own interests don't supercede.
* Factions now want a member on the council, not just a member in one of the councillor jobs.
* The Feudal Elective faction now once again requires Autonomous Vassals CA in order to form.
* The AI will no longer start claim wars or claimant revolts for titles that are currently contested in another war.
* The AI will only abandon a close-relation NAP for their claim if they dislike you enough to be eligible to form a claimant faction for it.
* Halved the prestige gain from all minor titles.
* It should be possible now for non-crownlaw titles to pass Title Revocation & Administration laws.
* NWO should no longer sometimes generate children for children
* NWO should properly generate a Catholic pope and an Orthodox patriarch when selecting the "Schismatic Christians" option
* Ambitions to become a councillor no longer apply if the ruler already has an advisor title.
* Lowered the Piety requirement for coronation from 100 to 25.
* Faction leaders can no longer propose an ultimatum or revolt at a faction meeting if their liege has a liege who has declared Realm Peace, and thus they cannot actually revolt.
* Council AI will now take into consideration the target's crime when voting on imprisonment, banishment, or execution.
* The AI will now use a wider range of jobs for its councillors.
* Councillors now can only be given one job every six months, same as in vanilla. This will also prevent player councillors from being spammed with job requests.
* Strength of province-based revolts has been reduced by 20% across the board (since opinions are now lower, and thus levy size is harder to increase).
* 'Suppress Revolts' action for marshals has had its revolt risk reduction increase from 2% to 5%, and the arrest chance modifier from 5% to 10%.
* There is now a random event for the 'Suppress Revolt' job when the marshal is stationed in a province not of his liege's culture/religion or with a province modifier which add significant revolt risk that he will get into a battle with peasant rabble, and either anger or cow the population as a result (affecting revolt risk for five years).
* The "In Hiding" trait no longer disallows rulers from serving as councillors.
* Updated tributary-renewal events to only apply to the suzerain's death (since tributes are automatically renewed now when the tribute dies).
* Fixed bug that would make some reformed pagan religion head titles be made primary even over higher-tier titles upon save.
* The AI should now actually change succession laws on occasion, as intended.
* Succession laws which were only unlocked with Late Feudal Adminstration now are also unlocked at a certain level of Crown Authority, as well.
* Fixed bug in a vanilla event that would cause a man to impregnate himself via an event with the "Way of Life" DLC disabled
* Lowered # of powerful vassals which demand a seat on the council by 1 (owing to the fact that Spymasters and Lord Spirituals are more restricted in CK2Plus as to who can hold the title).
* The Byzantium reclamation event will now also fire for someone of emperor-tier if their primary title is titular.
* Fixed create_provincia_britannia so that it adds d_oxford and d_powys to actually be de Jure k_britannia.
* Added an event which should spawn in norse duchy adventurers on occasion between the start of the Viking Age and 1000 AD.
* Adolescent romance events can now only happen once per character.
* Reduced chance of the AI selecting the Homosexual outcome with the adolescent romance events.
* Reduced frequency of mercenaries eloping with daughters and dueling with sons.
