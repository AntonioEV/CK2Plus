changelog 3.06.7

* Liberation revolts, provided they are under an existing ruler, will now unite under that ruler the same as faction revolts.
* Fixed several pagan holy orders which were not updating when the religion was reformed (NOTE: this is not retroactive on old saves).
* The Magyars now have a decision to simulate the 867 bookmark's invasion of Carpathia, for a CM bookmark start. It's permitted after 800 if they are between 6-12 realm size and neighbor a realm that owns Pest, though the AI won't take it until much later.
