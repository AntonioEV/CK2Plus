changelog 4.01.2

* MAJOR: New Millenium bookmark re-added (and also fixed and reworked).
* MAJOR: Tributes are no longer automatically ended when one of the rulers dies. If the suzerain dies, all tributes receive an event a day later asking if they wish to pay tribute to his heir. If they do, the new suzerain receives and event (and can refuse, setting them free). If they decline, the heir receives an event and can let them go or start an immediate war to reclaim them. If the tribute dies, his heir receives an event and is presented with the same choice: pay tribute to the suzerain or decline and possibly face invasion. NOTE: The same is NOT the case when the title of either ruler changes hands in any other way than death -- usurpation or the like will automatically end the tribute.
* Byzantine Subjugation CB now requires a CA of Medium or higher. It also now targets a de jure duchy, and if the holder of the duchy (or counties within the duchy, if the duchy has no holder) has no counties outside of the needed regions they will be vassalized. If they do hold counties outside the region, or are Emperor-tier, the duchy will be usurped instead.
* Removed the change to the Rhine, moving it back to its original vanilla location (to free up mod space).
* Fixed Afghan, Baloch, and Sogdian retinues.
* Fixed up the event chains for Seljuk, Timur, and Sabuktigin to appear. Seljuk in particular is likely to first appear as a nomad adventurer, though he will quickly settle if he takes feudal territory.
* Fixed Enforce Chalcedon and Enforce Ephesus decisions so they can actually be used by Nestorians and Miaphysites, respectively.
* Made Edward the Confessor once more "Eadward".
* Bulgarian provinces in the Charlemagne bookmark have been made Bolghar. They now convert to Bulgarian through event, and a 'Embrace Bulgarian Culture' conversion decision has been added.
* Avar provinces in Wallachia in the Charlemagne bookmark have been changed to Vlach culture.
* Nomad set-up has been altered so they now have the temple holdings which should be present in their provinces, and provinces which should have a different culture/religion will be maintained. This means that some provinces have tribal holdings, and cannot be destroyed via Pillage Holding until and unless the culture and religion of the province matches the nomad ruler.
* Randomly-generated AI daughters are now more varied -- but they appear after 1 day, instead of immediately at game start.
* Many of the opinion modifiers which allowed execution now also allow banishment.
* Duchy of Toulouse made independent from the New Millenium bookmark up until 1229, which is when it finally submitted to French rule.
* The Army of Lucifer is no longer active at game start.
* Forces/forts are no longer required to maintain an empty province as occupied.
* Once the Patriarch Supreme is appointed, all new priests will take his rite, and any challenges he makes to existing priests' rites will not lower Chalcedonian MA.
* Fixed kharijite execution decision to not make the executioner a kinslayer unless warranted.
* Pechenegs are now nomadic in the Old Gods bookmark and tribal in the later bookmarks.
* Added a tooltip to make it easier to understand when you can't pillage the last non-nomadic holding in a province that isn't of your culture and religion.
* Removed the fixes to uncle/aunt/cousin opinions as well as the decisions which would promote marriage to non-close relatives.
* Replaced the blue blindfold with the one from CPRplus thanks to the courteous permission of sifsilver and the CPRplus team
