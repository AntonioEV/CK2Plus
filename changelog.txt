changelog 3.05.4

* For any Shattered World, ancient religions start the inheritance law rules regarding non-gender type inheritance has been relaxed to be the same as any non-tribal Christian in a regular game
* Italian Reconquest chain should no longer fire for the "Ancient Religions" Shattered Realm start
* Revamped the process by which someone can convert to a pagan (or ancient) religion. Taking the Scholarship focus will eventually prompt a "pursue ancient knowledge" event -- and, if you take it, will start a chain that can ultimately result in you gaining the cynical, mystic and/or sympathy traits...all of which are requirements for the conversion. If you don't have the Way of Life DLC, a "Seek Ancient Knowledge" decision is available to start the chain off instead.
* Separated County Conquest CB back into pagan and muslim versions. Pagan version once again has the religious authority gain/loss associated.
