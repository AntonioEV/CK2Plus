changelog 4.04.4

* MAJOR: India has been removed in core CK2+. Save games made prior to this change will NOT be compatible unless the "CK2+ India" sub-mod is used
* MAJOR: "CK2+ India" sub-mod added to enable India
* Cleaned up the tooltips for when the "Recent Uprising" modifiers are applied to provinces after a rebellion is defeated.
* Fixed options tooltip in child's combat training event.
* Adventurers now only recruit from provinces in the demesne of a ruler who has given them permission to do so. They must approach the top liege of the realm, and if given permission to remain must go to each vassal in that realm in turn. If they are not permitted to remain by the top liege, they cannot approach any of his vassals. Adventurers are now restricted to a maximum distance from their point of origin (so no Irish adventurers wandering their way down into Africa, or similar).
* More holdings added into Alpunte province in Hispania.
* Seduction distance expanded to 150 (from 100) or in the same realm (as the tooltip actually states). The AI will only target someone within the 150 distance, however, same realm or no.
* Added a player only diplo action for the sending of semi-custom amounts of wealth. This action will not grant any opinion modifiers.
* Updated the siege/capture events. Chances of capture (or other siege effects) should now be properly random.
* Trade Post tooltip updated to reflect restrictions better
