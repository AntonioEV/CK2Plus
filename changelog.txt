changelog 3.09.3

* Titular empire and kingdom titles that are supposed to be invalid with the Charlemagne DLC active are now made inactive instead, so they cannot be seen or even searched for. If you really want to, it is okay to make the DLC inactive and those titles will re-appear during the annual maintenance (as well as the reverse -- any titles which are held will not be made inactive during maintenance).
* Instead of making the "Form New Kingdom" and "Form New Empire" decisions disappear when you hold an invalid primary title, there is now a tooltip that tells you why.
* The "barren" modifier is now only added once a character gets married/becomes a consort, to prevent the AI from magically detecting it first.
* Updated tooltips on kidnap plot event so it doesn't display that you'll be killing yourself.
* Fixed Baloch, Sogdian and Tocharian charaters from not getting retinues
* Added Sahidic (Coptic) culture for Egyptians who are also Coptic/Monophysite. Egyptians characters/provinces that become Coptic/Monophysite can become Sahidic, as well as the reverse.
* Monks & Nuns will automatically become divorced when they gain the trait.
* Sons and daughters of estate holders now inherit them according to the liege's gender law.
