changelog 4.02

* Ransomed adventurers should now be properly imprisoned by their ransomer.
* Fixed the event text on the event which grants the administrator trait.
* The zealots raised by "Build Zeal" now remain if you are in a war with a primary attacker/defender of a different religion group or a heresy/parent of your own religion, not just for certain CB's.
* Religious/Heretic rebel uprisings now target the duchy of the province they began in, taking all same-religion provinces therein if they succeed (in addition to any provinces they occupy), rather than taking all same-religion provinces in the entire realm.
