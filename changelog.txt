changelog 3.05.3

* Unreformed Pagans can once again declare conquests on rulers outside of their religion group
* Added properly changing CoAs for various English titles for bookmarks (mostly between Norman and Saxon), courtesy of Polskers
* Added in Afghan cultural retinues
* Restored kidnap plot
* Restored seduce plot to non-playable characters (or by those who don't have the Way of Life DLC)
* Added a small chance for a non-homosexual seduced by a homosexual to gain the homosexual trait
* Altered the "Spy On" decision available through the Way of Life DLC. It now has the following possible effects:
	- it can discover plots
	- if your target is also the target of your plot (or a plot you support), your plot can get extra Plot Power and will trigger more quickly
	- if your target has a "real father", you can discover this and either blackmail the father or reveal the truth
	- if your target has a lover, you can discover this and either blackmail either party or reveal the truth
	- you can enflame a rivalry between two rulers who don't like each other
	- you can reduce relations between a character and their liege
	- you can spread rumors about your target
	(in other words, no more free murder/kidnap/fabricate treason actions)
* Activated the kingdom versions of the later Stem Duchy titles from start so they can be formed by the player (since the holders of those duchies can't use the "new kingdom" decision)
* Creating an Empire level title should now properly require holding three kingdom level titles in addition to the holding requirement
* Default start date rolled forward to the Millenium bookmark, fixing an earlier error which had it in 867.
