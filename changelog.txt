changelog 3.06.3

* Fixed spying event chain when you choose to immediately reveal your target's affair.
* The AI will fight for claims of spouses and occasionally friends/lovers even if that doesn't mean they'll become vassals afterwards.
* Adjusted the balance in scandinavia in the 769 start (specifically Sjaelland)
* Changed Slesvig's localization to Jylland since that's the proper name for the area the duchy encompasses.
* Changed the Kingdom of Sweden's Norse name to Vilkinaland to differentiate from the duchy of uppland (also because it's historically accurate)
* War during the planning stages of a feast will now properly cancel the feast.
* Elective Gavelkind is now open to non tribals.
* Removal of an antipope via the Antiking CB or the Depose Antipope CB now works normally.
* Tournaments and furusiyya cleaned up to work via triggers, similarly to feasts.
* Tournament 1st/2nd/3rd place events now influenced by personal combat rating as well as martial rating.
* Kemetic, Jewish and Zoroastrian "restore religious head" decisions will now promote the holder of a holy site within the restorer's realm (if available - otherwise another random priest will be promoted), to ensure that the religious head has land and can declare Great Holy Wars if otherwise available.

* Adventurers will no longer leave children and/or spouses behind as they move from court to court.
* Religion heads will no longer confront themselves over heresies in their own provinces.
* Holmgangs will now only have one possible outcome (previously you could get up to three if the defender had a much higher Combat Rating).
* Exapanded conversion of norse culture to include consideration of top liege culture.
* Norse characters will now be able to convert to any post-norse culture in their realm, and will only see one decision for it.
* Expanded eligible group of tribal courtiers who can initiate the temple-building chain.
* AI tribal rulers will now employ a priest, if they don't have one within their court (to enable the temple-building chain).
* Fixed some opinion modifiers being improperly applied during faction meetings.
* Giving titles to unlanded courtiers who are not of the ruler's dynasty or close relatives results in ALL factions being slightly displeased.
* Reformed pagans may now proseyletize to non-reformed pagan rulers, just as non-pagans can. Tweaked AI logic on reacting to missionaries.
* Removed 'Free Family' CB, since there's now a hard-coded exception to declaring war on anyone who holds close family members anyway.
* Non-inheriting eldest (and eligible, according to the gender law) children of a Tanist ruler will now get a Strong claim to the title.
* Non-inheriting eldest (and eligible, according to the gender law) children of a Feudal Elective ruler will be more likely to be supported as claimants by the AI.
