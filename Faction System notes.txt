NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTING THE FACTION SYSTEM:

The files (other than the obvious one in common\objectives):

	Decisions:
		faction_decisions 				#for the player making demands as faction leader, also includes the antiking faction demand decision
		faction_maintenance_decisions 	#the yearly decision fired by k_papal_state which updates faction variables
		
	Events:
		civil_war_events				#once a civil war begins, the factions decide who to support (and loyalists can be rewarded afterwards)
		faction_events					#this one is for faction meetings and votes on leadership & determining demands
		faction_joining_events 			#this one sets the flags for AI characters which determines which factions they can join
		faction_maintenance_events 		#the big one--it has the event for factions on character death and the big one which calculates faction moods (which is fired from a million other places)
		faction_notification_events 	#oddly, all the notification events fired by other faction files are located here (completely uncommented)
		faction_court_events  			#this and the ones below are events that pertain to each individual faction -- when they'll make demands, how the war begins, etc.
		faction_feudal_events
		faction_pretender_events
		faction_religious_events
		faction_separatist_events
		
THINGS TO CONSIDER:

	* when you do the faction_maintenance_events file, the "recalculate faction moods" event is the one that will make you go and replace the event id in all those other files (the stuff that we've commented out) with the new namespace id. It might be worth doing that one first. I usually use Notepad++ to Find in Files to locate where all those things currently are. Find in Files is your friend.
	
	* don't forget to do a quick check to see if an event id is used in the on_action file of the old mod -- the on_death one in faction_maintenance_events would be, for instance
	
	* what I do when I replace an event id with a namespace is put a comment beside it "#formerly (event id)" just in case I missed an event trigger, or there's one in a file that hasn't been transferred over yet, and that will allow me to locate the namespace later.
	
	* if you come across an event that's fired from within an event you're working on, do a quick Find in Files to see where that is. If it's in another file you're going to be working on, you can change it to its new namespace id later. If it's in a file that hasn't been transferred yet, let me know--that'll have to move up the list and be done sooner rather than later. If it's in a file that's already transferred, use the new namespace id.
